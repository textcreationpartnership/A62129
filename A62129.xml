            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PART I.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. SInce almo≈øt all Men (however different in other Opinions and Intere≈øts) have ever agreed in this, That there is a God, to who≈øe Power all Things are ≈øubject; That the true Service and Wor≈øhip of God (which is called Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40650:4"/> ≈øhall be rewarded with Future Happine≈øs; and, That the Neglect and Contempt of Religion ≈øhall be puni≈øhed with Future Mi≈øery; Every Man ≈øurely has rea≈øon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus much at lea≈øt, That what is ≈øo generally and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed may be po≈ø≈øibly, nay and is probably, a Truth. And where≈øoever there is a po≈ø≈øibility, and much more where there is a probability, of a great Good on the one hand, and a great Evil on the other; there certainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is contented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the reality of the thing; that he may not mi≈øs of the one, if it be attainable, nor fall into the other, if it be avoidable. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40650:4"/> That <hi>it is a very great folly for any Man to give over ≈øearching after the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, untill he has found it; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were able to demon≈øtrate, either that there is no God; or el≈øe, that there is no Wor≈øhip or Service due to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. In all Matters of great and ≈øerious Con≈øequence, no Man that is wi≈øe, will act by chance, and at random, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give ≈øome Rea≈øon for what he does. For he that does any thing, and knows not why, is more likely to do him≈øelf Hurt than Good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there are more Ways to the former, than to the latter. Since therefore Religion is a thing of the greate≈øt Moment and Importance that can be,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:5"/> I conclude, that <hi>no Man ought to chu≈øe his Religion blindly, and by chance; but that every Man ought to have ≈øome Rea≈øon for what he profe≈ø≈øes. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Religion,</hi> therefore, <hi>a Man is bred up in from his Youth, it certainly is very fit for him, when he comes to Years of Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to enquire into the Grounds and Rea≈øons of it.</hi> For otherwi≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible for him to know whether he be in the Right, or the Wrong; in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If there be a God, and if he requires any ≈øervice or wor≈øhip <hi>(i. e.</hi> any Religion) from us, it is undoubtedly for this End, that it may be a Trial of our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs and Obedience to him.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:5"/> Now, who≈øoever has a mind to prove his Servant, whether he will be faithful and obedient, he will not give him ≈øuch dark and intricate Commands, as ≈øhall puzzle him to find out the meaning of them; (For, how can a Servant approve him≈øelf faithful and obedient, if he be uncertain what it is that his Ma≈øter requires from him?) But he will ≈øurely give him ≈øuch Commands and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as are ea≈øie enough to be under≈øtood, however dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult they may be to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprized, or accompli≈øhed. I conclude therefore, That <hi>all the Duties of Religion, which God requires of any Man, mu≈øt needs be ea≈øie enongh for him to under≈øtand, however hard they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40650:6"/> may be to be practi≈øed.</hi> For, otherwi≈øe, Religion would be a Trial rather of a Man's Wit and Cunning, than of his Faithfulne≈øs and Obedience. And therefore al≈øo I cannot but conclude, That <hi>mo≈øt,</hi> if not all the <hi>Controver≈øies about Religion,</hi> which at this Day di≈øtract the World, <hi>do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any Difficulty in or about the Determination of all things nece≈ø≈øary in Religion it ≈øelf; but partly from the Pride of ≈øome Learned Men,</hi> who have loved to ≈øtrat new and difficult Que≈øtions, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe their private Sentiments upon the World, that they might be admired for their Wit and Subtilty; <hi>partly from the Covetou≈øne≈øs and Ambition
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:6"/> of ≈øome,</hi> whether Learned, or Unlearned, who have found that their Worldly Intere≈øt will be better ≈øerved by ≈øome Doctrins (no matter how fal≈øe and precarious) than by others; <hi>and partly from the Prejudice of mo≈øt Men,</hi> who are apt, with great Zeal and Eagerne≈øs, to contend for all tho≈øe things which, from their Childhood, they have been taught to have a Reverence for. And I farther conclude, That <hi>who≈øoever has a ≈øincere de≈øire to embrace True Religion, mu≈øt lay a≈øide Pride, Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetou≈øne≈øs and Prejudice,</hi> which would mi≈ø-guide him; <hi>and follow his ≈øober and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Rea≈øon,</hi> which will ever lead him in the right Way.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:7"/>IV. There are different ≈øorts, or rather degrees of A≈ø≈øurance, which Men have concerning Things. Some things are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of them≈øelves, without any Proof; ≈øome things we are a≈ø≈øured of, by the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our ≈øen≈øes; ≈øome things we receive as Truths, becau≈øe we find them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from other Truths alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received; and ≈øome things we believe only upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony of others. Moreover, ≈øome things we are per≈øuaded of, without any Doubt or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; whereas other things do ≈øeem, at be≈øt, to be but likely or probable, and that too in a different degree, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their Evidence is ≈øtronger, or weaker. Now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:7"/> every ≈øober Man, where he has certain Evidence of a thing, there he acts with A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance; where the Matter is but probable, there he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with Caution: But where a Man is under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of doing one way or other, and where the Matter appears doubtful on both ≈øides, there it becomes him to weigh the Rea≈øons on both parts with due Con≈øideration; and according as he finds the greater Probability to be on the one hand rather than the other, ≈øo to ≈øquare his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accordingly. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Man mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either live religiou≈øly or not live religiou≈øly; I conclude, that <hi>if upon a ≈øerious Con≈øideration
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:8"/> of the matter, there appear to be more probable Rea≈øons and Arguments for Religion than against it, every wi≈øe and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man mu≈øt embrace Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> This I ≈øay, not but that I think there are even demon≈øtrative Arguments for Religion; and not ≈øo much as one probable one again≈øt it: But becau≈øe that which to me ≈øeems demon≈øtrative, to another may appear but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I thought it fit to note, That every Man in point of common Prudence is obliged to follow Religion, if it does but appear more likely and probable to him than Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Whether it is po≈ø≈øible for any Agent to produce a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:8"/> new Being purely out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, may with much ≈øhew of Religion be doubted: As al≈øo Whether meer Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or efficient Cau≈øe, can ever be able to work it ≈øelf into any different Species or Forms. But this appears as certain as any thing can can be; That where there is neither any Agent or efficent Cau≈øe to work, nor any Matter or Subject to be wrought upon, there it is utterly impo≈ø≈øible for any thing ever to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Being. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I find that there are many things which actually have a Being and Exi≈øtence, I conclude, That <hi>of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity there mu≈øt be ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:9"/> or other which has been from all Eternity, and never had a Beginning.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, if we ≈øuppo≈øe that ever there was a time when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all did exi≈øt, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, from what has been ≈øaid, that it would be utterly impo≈ø≈øible that any thing ever ≈øhould be produced into Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtence.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Since of nece≈ø≈øity we mu≈øt acknowledge ≈øomething to have been Eternal, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude, That <hi>the Eternity of ≈øuch a Being as God is de≈øcribed to be, is much more probable and fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, than the Eternity of ≈øuch a Being as I ≈øee this World to be.</hi> For when I go about to convince a Nation of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:9"/> Eternity of the World (I mean in the like Po≈øture that now it is in) there do occurr to my Mind ≈øuch Difficulties, or rather Impo≈ø≈øibilities, as I think no Man can dige≈øt. For he that affirms the World, as now it ≈øtands, to have been Eternal, mu≈øt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity grant that there has been an Eternal Succe≈ø≈øion of Men, Bea≈øts, and Vegetables, and that to a number actually infinite: (for if the number be not infinite, how can the Succe≈ø≈øion have been Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?) And yet a number actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite to me appears to be a plain Contradiction. For that which is infinite cannot be made bigger, whereas there is no number but may be made

Again if any one ≈øhall affirm that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number is no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that there has been a Succe≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beings in the World; then thus I argue, That if there has been a Succe≈ø≈øion of an infinite number of Men, Bea≈øts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, by a Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rea≈øon, there has been al≈øo a Succe≈ø≈øion of an infinite number of Days and Nights; and if ≈øo, then likewi≈øe of an infinite number of Years too; (for if the number of Years can be limited, ≈øo can that of Days too, ≈øince every Year contains ju≈øt ≈øuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Days.) Now this I ≈øuppo≈øe mu≈øt be granted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:10"/> me, That infinite numbers are equal: (for if one number be le≈øs than another, how can it be infinite?) And if ≈øo, then it mu≈øt follow that in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the World the number of Years is equal to the number of Days, which is ab≈øurd; becau≈øe every Year contains in its ≈øelf a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 365 Days. The≈øe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or rather Impo≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I ≈øay, do make the notion of the World's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (I mean as the World now is) to appear to me as an ab≈øurd and unrea≈øonable Suppo≈øition.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40650:23"/> Lye upon the World, by which they could propo≈øe to them≈øelves no manner of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this Life, nor (if it were a Lye) in the Life to come; Who never would have expo≈øed them≈øelves to Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Racks, to Gibbets, to Fire and Faggot, (in a Word) to all ≈øorts of Torments and Deaths, only for the ≈øake of a fruitle≈øs and unprofitable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Who being Men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Lives, for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, had, doubtle≈øs, more Hone≈øty and Integrity, than to affirm tho≈øe things for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truths, which they mu≈øt needs know to be meer Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Who were too many in Number, and too void of Craft and Guile, to combine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40650:24"/> together in framing a fal≈øe Story, and none of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to betray or di≈øcover the Cheat; Who could never hope to impo≈øe the Belief of ≈øuch a Story upon a curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øitive Age (≈øuch as that was wherein they lived) if it had been fal≈øe, and therefore would certainly never have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if they had not known it to have been true; And, La≈øtly, who, in≈øtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ≈øuch Multitudes as they did, mu≈øt needs have been palpably di≈øcovered, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the World for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of lewd Cheats and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtors, in pretending that ≈øuch and ≈øuch things were done in the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> (and done openly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40650:24"/> too, in the Face of the World,) when it was ≈øo ea≈øie a matter to go or ≈øend to the place, to make Enquiry, and ≈øo to find out the Cheat, if a Cheat it had been. But that the≈øe ≈øame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and wonderful Works, did far ≈øurpa≈øs both the Cour≈øe of Nature, and the Power of Art, is very evident; That they were not perform'd by the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of any wicked Spirit, does ≈øufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; becau≈øe the very Intent and De≈øign of them was to propagate a Doctrine in the World, which, by all, mu≈øt be allowed to teach the pure≈øt, and mo≈øt ≈øtrict Morality; to which it cannot be imagined, that any Impure and Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would contribute any help.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40650:25"/> It remains therefore, that the≈øe things mu≈øt needs have been performed, either by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of God, (who is both the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Controller of Nature) or (which is the ≈øame thing in effect) by the Mediation and Mini≈øtry of good Spirits, who always act obediently to his Will. So that (whether me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or immediately) it is God who is to be looked upon as the Original and Author of all tho≈øe wonderful Things, which were done by Je≈øus, and his Di≈øciples. Now then; Since God did interpo≈øe his Power, to work ≈øuch ≈øtrange and ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penduous things, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and Confirmation of that Doctrine which was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40650:25"/> taught by Je≈øus and his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; This I think, is a ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demon≈øtration, that their Doctrine was certainly true. For, Who can imagine that God ≈øhould make u≈øe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Power, only to cheat and deceive the World into the Belief of a Lye? I conclude therefore, That <hi>the Primitive Chri≈øtians had ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rea≈øon to believe, that it was revealed by God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that who≈øoever would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Je≈øus, and receive, and live according to his Religion, ≈øhould be made very happy in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next Life;</hi> this very thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grand Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which Je≈øus and his Di≈øciples taught and preached to the World. And if we are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40650:26"/> ≈øure that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians had Rea≈øon ≈øufficient to believe this; from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That <hi>we have ≈øufficient Rea≈øon to believe it al≈øo.</hi>

And, as for the Texts of Scripture which they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40650:28"/> alledge, it is even ridiculous to think, that any ≈øober and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Per≈øon ≈øhould be convinced by them; (as will evidently appear to any one, who impartially reads what the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> and Prote≈øtant Divines have written on this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øie:) For there are none of tho≈øe Texts, but are fairly and naturally capable of another Interpretation; and mu≈øt be very much ≈øtrained and wre≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make them countenance the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Doctrine. Be≈øides that, the Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do generally teach, That no Man can be ≈øure of the Authority or Sen≈øe of any Text of Scripture, (e≈øpecially if it appear to be any way doubtful,) except he receives
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40650:28"/> the Propo≈øal and Interpretation thereof from this their Church, which they ≈øay is infallible.

How then can I be ≈øure that this or that particular Per≈øon does both rightly under≈øtand, and faithfully propo≈øe the Doctrine of the Church to me?

                  <p n="22">XXII. Some there are who tell me, that, to find out the true and genuine Doctrine of Je≈øus, I mu≈øt have recour≈øe to the Tradition of the Church:

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40650:31"/> and con≈øtantly taught and preached, every ≈øucceeding Age and Generation mu≈øt needs know, and could not po≈ø≈øibly be ignorant, what their Fathers, and immediate Predece≈ø≈øors owned and taught as ≈øuch. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if, at any time what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, any new or ≈øpurious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was, or ≈øhould be, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any Per≈øon or Per≈øons, as the Doctrine of Je≈øus, all Chri≈øtians mu≈øt pre≈øently know that this was none of his Doctrine, becau≈øe it was not taught them as ≈øuch, by their immediate Predece≈ø≈øors. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That therefore it is impo≈ø≈øible that any new and ≈øpurious Doctrine could ever be broached in the World, as a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40650:32"/> part of the Doctrine of Je≈øus, but it mu≈øt needs meet with great Oppo≈øition: For all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians do maintain, That it is a Sin to teach, or knowingly to own, any thing as the Doctrine of Je≈øus, which is not really ≈øo. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That however ≈øome Men, out of Pride or Intere≈øt, may own and contend for any ≈øuch novel Doctrines, yet it is impo≈ø≈øible that any ≈øuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ≈øhould ever come to be univer≈øally received by the whole Church, except we could ≈øuppo≈øe, either that the whole Church ≈øhould joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to involve them≈øelves and their Po≈øterity for ever in a Sin; or el≈øe, that a few Men, who fir≈øt ≈øhould vent an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, could ≈øo impo≈øe upon the

And <hi>La≈øtly,</hi> That no part of the Doctrine of Je≈øus, once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, could ever be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or wholly forgot in the World; becau≈øe every Age of Chri≈øtians, from the very fir≈øt, who undoubtedly received the whole and entire Doctrine of Je≈øus, knew them≈øelves to be indi≈øpen≈øably obliged, both by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40650:33"/> God's Command, and al≈øo by that Love and Charity which they owed to their Po≈øterity to teach the ≈øame full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Doctrine which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, unto their Children and tho≈øe who were to come after them. Go therefore to the Church (that is, to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts; to the Univer≈øal Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to all Chri≈øtians, ≈øay ≈øome Prote≈øtants,) and ≈øee what are the Doctrines which are, and have been univer≈øally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; of who≈øe Beginning no other Account can be given, but that Je≈øus and his Apo≈øtles taught them to the World: And there you have the entire and uncorrupted Doctrine of Je≈øus. But to this I an≈øwer,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40650:33"/> That, indeed, where there is an univer≈øal, or a very large and general Tradition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any thing; and where; from the nature of the thing it ≈øelf, it appears to be highly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and probable, that there is not, or could not be, any Errour or Mi≈øtake in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe as this, no Man, I think, but an ob≈øtinate Sceptick, will offer to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Evidence of ≈øuch a Tradition. But, let a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ever ≈øo general, or even univer≈øal; yet, if it can be ≈øhewn, that there is not only a po≈ø≈øibility, but al≈øo a fair like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and probability, that there may be a mi≈øtake in the bu≈øine≈øs; then, I think, no Man can ju≈øtly be blamed, if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40650:34"/> he refu≈øes or ≈øu≈øpends his A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, until the Te≈øtimony of ≈øuch a Tradition be cleared and vindicated from tho≈øe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Prejudices and Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may lie again≈øt it. Now, if it were ≈øo, that all Errours and Mi≈øtakes did ever immediately appear in their perfect Form, and full Growth, at their very Beginning; then it were mo≈øt rational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all Men mu≈øt needs take notice of their fir≈øt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and con≈øequently, that, in all likelihood, any ≈øuch Error mu≈øt needs meet with many more Opponents, than Abettors. But, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it may well be ≈øuppo≈øed, that Errours may have ≈øprung up in the World, from ≈øuch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40650:34"/> ≈ømall beginnings, and by ≈øuch ≈ølow and unperceivable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that, after ≈øome Ages, it may be impo≈ø≈øible for a Man to di≈øcover them to be Errours, except he has ≈øome other Rule, be≈øides Tradition, to try them by; <hi>viz.</hi> either the Rule of common Rea≈øon, or ≈øome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and unaltered Writing. As for Example; It is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to conceive, that, in the fir≈øt Ages of Chri≈øtianity, they who preached and writ popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Di≈øcour≈øes, might, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, and to good purpo≈øe, make u≈øe of Rhetorical Flights, and Figurative Expre≈ø≈øions, to ≈øtrike the Fancies, and move the Affections of the People to Vertue and Piety? And is it not likely enough, That tho≈øe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40650:35"/> who came after them, might not only ≈øtrive to imitate, but al≈øo to out-do them, in bolder Flights, and more ≈øtrained Schemes of Expre≈ø≈øion? And is it not al≈øo probable enough, That, in long proce≈øs of Time, Ignorance, generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpreading the Face of the World, and being joyned with a profound Veneration for tho≈øe ancient Preachers and Writers, might begin to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret ≈øome of the≈øe Rhetorical and Figurative Expre≈ø≈øions in a Literal and Logical Sence; and then conceive, that ≈øuch their Interpretations were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines delivered down to them? E≈øpecially if we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there may have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40650:35"/> ≈øome Men of great Power and Repute in the World, who might have taken a pride and delight, or who≈øe Intere≈øt it might have been, to amuze the People with my≈øterious Notions and Fancies, and to keep them ignorant of the Truth. And thus it appears to be, not only po≈ø≈øible, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo probable enough, That Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Mi≈øtakes, as to the ancient Doctrine of Je≈øus, might come to be generally received, without any con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or notorious Oppo≈øition given to them; or that ≈øuch Oppo≈øition might ≈øoon be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed and over-ruled by the Power and Reputation of ≈øuch prevailing Men. From all which I cannot but conclude,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40650:36"/> That <hi>though the general Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Te≈øtimony of the Church may be a good Help, yet it may not always be a certain Rule, to lead me to the entire, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Doctrine of Je≈øus.</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40650:37"/> between them; the only ≈øeeming Di≈øcord, of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ju≈øtification by Faith, and St. <hi>James</hi>'s Ju≈øtification by Works, being exactly and fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, by con≈øidering, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> means no other Faith, but ≈øuch as worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and St. <hi>James,</hi> no other Works, but ≈øuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 22.) But becau≈øe it was not at fir≈øt univer≈øally known, who were the Authors of them. Which abundantly ≈øhews the Care and Caution of the Chri≈øtian Church, in not being ha≈øty to receive and admit any Books, as authentick Records of their Doctrine, without very good Warrant for ≈øo doing. And therefore, ≈øince the≈øe ≈øame
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40650:38"/> Books were, in a very little time after, received, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of equal Authority with the re≈øt of the <hi>New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I cannot but from thence conclude, That tho≈øe Churches which, at the fir≈øt, doubted concerning tho≈øe Books, did ≈øoon receive mo≈øt full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Satisfaction in that matter, from tho≈øe who had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That <hi>the Book of the</hi> New Te≈øtament, <hi>as it was extant in the Primitive Times, in the Greek Tongue, did contain a true Account of the Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. That innumerable Copies of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> were, in a very little time, di≈øper≈øed through all places
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40650:38"/> where Chri≈øtianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; That it has heen, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, and in very di≈øtant places, tran≈ølated into all (or almo≈øt all) Languages; And that Copies, both of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and many of the ≈øeveral Tran≈ølations, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved with much Care, in a great many di≈øtant Parts of the World, is allowed by all, and denied by none. From whence I think we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That <hi>where the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Greek Copies of the</hi> New Te≈øtament <hi>do agree in the very ≈øame Words, there we have, undoubtedly, the true and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Words of the</hi> New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, although ≈øome Mi≈øtakes might creep into ≈øome Copies, either through
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40650:39"/> the Wickedne≈øs or Negligence of ≈øome particular Men; yet, where ≈øo many Copies of a Book have been ≈øo carefully pre≈øerved, and in ≈øuch di≈øtant Parts of the World, it is not to be imagined, that the ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øame Errour, in any Expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, ≈øhould ever be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Generality of them. Secondly, That <hi>where the Words or Expre≈ø≈øions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Greek Copies do differ one from another; yet if the Sen≈øe and Meaning be exactly the ≈øame in all, or almo≈øt all; there we have certainly the true Sen≈øe and Meaning of the</hi> New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For it is ea≈øie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that a Tran≈øcriber might, by a ≈ømall Mi≈øtake, put one Word or Expre≈ø≈øion of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40650:39"/> ≈øame Signification, in ≈øtead of another: But that the ≈øame Sen≈øe ≈øhould be punctually pre≈øerved in all, or almo≈øt all, Copies is not to be imagined, except it were the true Sen≈øe delivered from the Beginning. Thirdly, That <hi>if there may be found any different Readings in divers Copies of the</hi> New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, <hi>which di≈øagree in Sen≈øe, as well as in Words,</hi> (which ≈øcarce ever happens in any thing which is accounted a material Point of Religion) <hi>then it ≈øeems to be mo≈øt fit and proper to admit of that Reading and Sen≈øe which be≈øt agrees with the Tenour of the whole; with the ancientest, and best e≈øteemed Tran≈ølations; and with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles of ≈øound Rea≈øon.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40650:40"/> And if any place be ≈øo ob≈øcure, as that none of the≈øe Ways will afford any Light into its Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then I think that no ≈øtre≈øs ought to be laid upon it in any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary part of Religion.</hi>

                  <p n="25">XXV. But ≈øome will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How are we ≈øure of the Sen≈øe and Meaning, even of tho≈øe places of the <hi>New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Words? In An≈øwar to this, I have already ≈øhewn, (¬ß. 21.) that we are not to follow the Guidance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know the true Doctrine of Je≈øus; Nor therefore, con≈øequently, to know the true Meaning of the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> in which his Doctrine is owned to be contained. I have ≈øhewn al≈øo,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40650:40"/> (¬ß. 22.)

And one thing more let me add, for the ≈øake of tho≈øe who are not skilled in the Greek Tongue; <hi>viz.</hi> That ≈øince there have many Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølations been made of the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> mo≈øt of them by Per≈øons well skilled in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, of good Repute for their Hone≈øty and Integrity, and who could not but know before-hand, that their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølations would be narrowly ≈øif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and examined by learned Men; (which mu≈øt needs make them careful to commit as few Faults as they could;) and ≈øince all tho≈øe things which God requires from Men, mu≈øt needs be ea≈øie enough to be under≈øtood, (¬ß. 3.) and therefore ea≈øie to be tran≈ølated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40650:43"/> in any Language; I cannot but conclude, That <hi>a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and impartial Enquirer may be very well a≈ø≈øured of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Je≈øus, even from the Tran≈ølations of the</hi> New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>though he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Greek Original.</hi> And, for as much as I can under≈øtand of the matter, if Men did ≈øtand only upon the hone≈øt and downright Sen≈øe and Meaning of plain Places, (which only can ≈øtive us good A≈ø≈øurance in Religion,) and would not quarrel about critical Niceties in ≈øuch Texts as are confe≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ob≈øcure, I believe there is ≈øcarce any Tran≈ølation of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> ≈øo defective, but might be a ≈øufficient Guide to any ≈øober Man, to

                  <p n="29">XXIX. Having thus ≈øpoken what I de≈øigned of the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> I come to ≈øay ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Old.</hi> And here, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Days of Je≈øus, had among them a Book, written in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ≈øome ≈ømall part of it in the <hi>Chaldee-</hi>Tongue, which we now call the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> which they called the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and e≈øteemed as the Word of God, is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond di≈øpute. That this Book was owned and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, quoted and referred to, and all People exhorted and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ≈øearch and ≈øtudy it, as the Word of God, both by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus him≈øelf, and al≈øo by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciples,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40650:44"/> is mo≈øt evident to any one who reads the <hi>New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> From whence I mu≈øt conclude, That <hi>the Doctrine of that Book, as it was then extant, is to be e≈øteemed as part of the Doctrine of Je≈øus; and that tho≈øe Laws and Commands which are there to be found, are to be kept and ob≈øerved by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, the Followers of Je≈øus; except where it can be ≈øhewn that Je≈øus has freed us from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">XXX. Moreover, ≈øince this Book has been Tran≈ølated into as many Languages, and as many Copies of the Original have been carefully kept, in di≈øtant Parts of the World, as of the <hi>New Te≈øtament;</hi> I do conclude, That <hi>the very ≈øame
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40650:45"/> things which just now were ≈øaid concerning the Words, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Way of interpreting the</hi> New Te≈øtament, <hi>will hold good concerning the</hi> Old Te≈øtament <hi>al≈øo, as far as they can be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">XXXI. There are ≈øome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Books and Fragments, which among the Prote≈øtants are well known by the Name of <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> to which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts give the Title of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical.</hi> The≈øe Pieces the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts contend to be a real part of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> and of equal Authority with the other Books of it: But the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants will not allow their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be ≈øacred, although they grant that there are many u≈øeful and profitable things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40650:45"/> contained in them. Now, he that is not able to ≈øearch into Antiquity, for the Re≈øolving of this Controver≈øie, may by another way be ≈øatisfied about it.

                  <p n="32">XXXII. But there are ≈øome Difficulties which ≈øeem to ari≈øe concerning what I have di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed, to which it will be nece≈ø≈øary to give a full and ≈øatisfactory An≈øwer. And, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> If all be granted that has hitherto been ≈øaid; yet, how ≈øhall I be ≈øure that the Book of the holy Scriptures contains, not only truly, but al≈øo fully and entirely, the Doctrine of Je≈øus; ≈øo that nothing is to be e≈øteemed as a part of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what is contained in the Scripture? To this I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40650:46"/> might an≈øwer, That there are ≈øeveral Pa≈ø≈øages in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ≈øelf, which do give us to under≈øtand, that the whole Law and Will of God, as far as it is needful for Man to know them, are contained in tho≈øe holy Writings; (as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Divines do ≈øufficiently make appear, in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Controver≈øie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Papi≈øts.) But, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, I think it is enough to ≈øay, That <hi>it is not, indeed, impo≈ø≈øible in it ≈øelf, but that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus might have made known other Particulars of Doctrine, and of the Will of God, be≈øides what is con≈øigned to us by the Scripture. And if any Man can effectually prove, that any ≈øuch Doctrine or Precept was delivered by him;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40650:47"/> I think, that who≈øoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Proof, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Doctrine, and obey that Precept, which appear to be ≈øo delivered. But he that does his hearty and ≈øincere Endeavour to find out the Doctrine and Will of God, delivered to Man by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, and is not able, with all his Diligence, to di≈øcover any more of it, than what is recorded in the Scripture; if he faithfully keeps and ob≈øerves as much of it as he is able there to di≈øcover, it is plain that God requires no more from him,</hi> (¬ß. 14.) and therefore certainly will not puni≈øh him, for want of any thing farther.</p>
                  <p n="33">XXXIII. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be objected, That in Reading the≈øe Books, there do appear to be ≈øome Pa≈ø≈øages which are in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40650:47"/> them≈øelves ab≈øurd, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the plain Dictates of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Rea≈øon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding; and ≈øome which are irreconcileable with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, that the Doctrine of Je≈øus is certainly true, mu≈øt be allowed, becau≈øe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God. That both parts of a Contradiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, is acknowledged by all Men: And no Man, I think, can own that for a Truth, which is contrary to the plain Dictates of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and Under≈øtanding; which to every Man is, and mu≈øt be, the Standard of all Truth what≈øoever. For there can be no Rea≈øon why any Man receives and owns any thing for a Truth, but only becau≈øe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40650:48"/> he apprehends it to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto the plain and ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Notions which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready planted in his Mind. Here then it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how it canbe po≈ø≈øible that the≈øe Scriptures ≈øhould contain the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of Je≈øus? To this I an≈øwer: <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That <hi>I cannot find any appearance of a Contradiction, throughout the Holy Scriptures, in any Point of Doctrine, or Rule of Manners, but what is ≈øo ea≈øie and obvious to be reconciled,</hi> that no Man, I think, of Candour and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, but would be a≈øhamed to object it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And, <hi>as for tho≈øe few ≈øeeming Di≈øcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances, which do occurr in the Circum≈øtances of ≈øome Hi≈øtorical
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40650:48"/> Narrations; though I, perhaps, am not able to reconcile them, yet it may be that the things them≈øelves may not be ab≈øolutely irreconcilable. But ≈øuppo≈øe they were, yet it is no derogation to the Truth of the Hi≈øtory, (as to the main ≈øub≈øtance of it, ) or of the Doctrine contained in the holy Scriptures, that ≈øome of the Sacred Writers have been mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Relation of ≈øome ≈ømall and incon≈øiderable Circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> There are ≈øeveral Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Chroniclers, which give an Account of the Life and Reign of many of our Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ in many Circum≈øtances of things, yet this was never made an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doubt of the Truth of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40650:49"/> the main Hi≈øtory, wherein they all agree. And why may not the Scripture-Hi≈øtorians be as favourably cen≈øured as all other Hi≈øtorians in the World are? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which are above my Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding which I cannot comprehend in my Mind, nor frame a clear and di≈øtinct Notion of; which yet I cannot ≈øay, are contrary to my Rea≈øon: Becau≈øe (though they are above my reach, yet) I do not find that they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict any of tho≈øe plain and ≈øelf-evident Principles which are implanted in my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding. For Example, I am not able di≈øtinctly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the ≈ømalle≈øt Particle of Matter, which can be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40650:49"/> is yet in it ≈øelf capable of being for ever divided; ≈øo that no part of Matter, though ever ≈øo ≈ømall, can ever be ≈øo much as convinced to be ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely invi≈øible. And yet this is ≈øo far from being contrary to my Rea≈øon, that my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon it ≈øelf does fully ≈øatisfie me that the thing is ≈øo, though I am not able to comprehend the manner of it. The ≈øame thing al≈øo may be ≈øaid concerning the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øome thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without any Beginning. (of which, ≈øee ¬ß. 5, 6.) Now <hi>if I meet with any thing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which is thus above my Rea≈øon, but not contrary to it, I cannot refu≈øe my A≈ø≈øent unto it.</hi> (I mean always, upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition that the Words do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40650:50"/> evidently to carry ≈øuch a Sen≈øe.) For I cannot conclude ≈øuch a thing to be impo≈ø≈øible: Becau≈øe I do not find it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my Rea≈øon, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. And if it be a thing in my Apprehen≈øion po≈ø≈øible, I mu≈øt believe it to be true, when I find that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it ≈øo to be. Other things, again, there are, which are directly contrary unto tho≈øe ≈øelf-evident Notions and Principles, which my Rea≈øon finds to be connatural with it ≈øelf. For Example; That <hi>a Part is equal to the Whole;</hi> and ≈øuch like Ab≈øurdities. Now, <hi>if any</hi> ≈øuch <hi>Propo≈øitions</hi> as the≈øe, <hi>which are contrary to my Rea≈øon, ≈øhould occurr to me in Scripture, I cannot po≈ø≈øibly believe them to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40650:50"/> be true in a Literal Sen≈øe;</hi> (for that were to renounce the clear Dictates of my Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding, upon which the Certainty of all things which I believe or know, is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately built; and without which, I could have no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Being of God, or the Truth of any Religion;) <hi>and therefore I mu≈øt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them to be meant figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi> And that Figure which be≈øt agrees to ≈øuch Words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mo≈øt common Cu≈øtom of Speech, and is mo≈øt conformable to common Sen≈øe and Rea≈øon, I think, is always to be preferred. I never read any Book, to my knowledge, but in it I found many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions which, taken literally
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40650:51"/> and ≈øtrictly, were ab≈øurd and ridiculous; but, taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as 'tis evident they were intended, did contain very good Sen≈øe and Meaning. Since then the Holy Scriptures were written in ≈øuch Words and Expre≈ø≈øions as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly u≈øed among Men in Speaking and Writing, why ≈øhould we think that ≈øtrange in them, which is ≈øo u≈øual in all other Books?</p>
                  <p n="34">XXXIV. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be objected, That this Doctrine which I have taught, leaves every Man entirely to his own Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding, to find out the true Religion, and the Way to Heaven. Now, ≈øince there is ≈øo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Notions and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40650:51"/> Sentiments of different Men, it mu≈øt needs follow, that, all Men being left wholly to them≈øelves, there mu≈øt nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarily be great Variety, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Contrariety, of Opinions among them concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if God requires no more from every Man, but to do his be≈øt Endeavour, and to chu≈øe that way which he thinks to be the true≈øt; from hence it will follow, That two Men who are contrary one to another in the Point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may yet both be in the right Way to Heaven; and a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a Heathen, may be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as well as a Chri≈øtian, if they are but ≈øtrongly per≈øua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are in the right. I an≈øwer; <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That if the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40650:52"/> Objection means, that I leave every Man to his own Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding, without any other help, to find out the Trut of Religion, it is a mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. For I have a≈ø≈øerted, That every Man, according to the Mea≈øure of his Learning, ought to make u≈øe of all the Means and Helps he can, to under≈øtand the Scriptures, and the Will of God. (See ¬ß. 14. and ¬ß. 25.) But if the Meaning be, That <hi>I leave every Man to chu≈øe that Religion which, after a ≈øerious Enquiry, appears to him to be the be≈øt;</hi> (which is all that I contend for;) In this I ≈øay no more than what all Men mu≈øt, and do, ≈øay, as well as I. For, either a Man mu≈øt never enquire into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40650:52"/> Truth of his Religion at all, (and then he chu≈øes his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by mere chance; and ≈øince there are many fal≈øe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and but one true, 'tis great odds but he lights upon a wrong one;) Or, if he does enquire. either he mu≈øt chu≈øe that which he thinks not to be the be≈øt, (and then he acts again≈øt his Con≈øcience,) or that which he thinks is the be≈øt; Which is what I a≈ø≈øert, and what every Man of Sen≈øe profe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf to do. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> As there are many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Notions and Sentiments of Men, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho≈øe things which are, in ≈øome mea≈øure, ab≈øtru≈øe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure; ≈øo, on the other ≈øide, there are many things ≈øo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40650:53"/> and evident, that Men who are ≈øincere and unbya≈ø≈øed, if they have but common Sen≈øe, can never differ about them: Among≈øt which, I think, I may reckon all tho≈øe things which God requires of nece≈ø≈øity to any Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton (¬ß. 3.) And whereas the World has, for the≈øe many Years, found, that compelling Men to this or that Religion, contrary to their own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has been ≈øo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Unity of any ≈øort, that, on the contrary, it has even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracted Mankind, not only with Variety of Opinions, (each Party taking a delight to thwart other,) but al≈øo with War and Confu≈øion; If every Man were left to him≈øelf, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40650:53"/> follow what Religion he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, (as he ≈øhall an≈øwer to God for his Sincerity,) it is very probable that mo≈øt Men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Worldly Intere≈øt to ≈øerve by this or that Religion, would in time, be brought to agree in all the great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary Truths of Religion; which are plain and evident to every ≈øober and inqui≈øitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. And as for things not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, and of an inferiour ≈øort, (as I have ≈øaid, ¬ß. 26.) if Men would be but peaceable, their Mi≈øtakes, and con≈øequently their Differences about them, could do no great harm.

How God will deal with tho≈øe that are mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cannot help it, I do not determine. All that I would in≈øinuate (¬ß. 14.) is, That he will not puni≈øh any Man for any Errour, or Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, which he falls into, through a pure De≈øect of his Under≈øtanding, and not through any Fault or Neglect
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40650:54"/> of his Will. But how far he will reward ≈øuch a Per≈øon for his good Meaning, is more than I can tell.</p>
                  <p n="35">XXXV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be objected, That this Doctrine does, in effect, undermine and enervate the Force and Power of all Civil Government, by opening a Way for all Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to e≈øcape Puni≈øhment, how great ≈øoever their Crimes may be. If ≈øuch a Per≈øon ≈øhould plead thus for him≈øelf, That he was fully per≈øuaded in his Mind and Con≈øcience, that it was the Will of God, that he ≈øhould commit ≈øuch a The≈øt, or Murther, of which he is accu≈øed; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it was his Duty, in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40650:55"/> ≈øight of God, to act according to this Per≈øua≈øion; The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate, who knows not the Hearts of Men, can never be able certainly to di≈øcover, but that this is a real Truth, that he was ≈øo per≈øuaded. And if every Man, in all the Duties of Religion, is bound to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Sen≈øe and Per≈øua≈øion of Things; with what Con≈øcience can a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate puni≈øh ≈øuch a Per≈øon for that Fact, which, for ought he knows, it was his Duty to commit? I will not ≈øay, but that it may ≈øo fall out, that a Man may think it to be his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to commit the mo≈øt horrid Villanies, ≈øince Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf a≈ø≈øures his Di≈øciples, That the Time would come,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40650:55"/> that who≈øo killed them, would think he did God Service, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. And how far God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will be merciful unto ≈øuch Per≈øons who commit ≈øuch Facts out of pure Ignorance, and not out of Malice, I had rather St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine than I. (See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.) But to the Objection, I think it ≈øufficient to an≈øwer, That the Civil Magi≈øtrate, as well as other Men is bound to act according to the cleare≈øt Conviction, and ≈øtronge≈øt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øua≈øion of his own Mind. If therefore, upon the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Circum≈øtances, he be well ≈øatisfied, and really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that ≈øuch a Plea from a Malefactor is no real Truth; but only a me≈øe Trick, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40650:56"/> in hopes to e≈øcape Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment; he ought to take no notice of it, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Sentence according to the Law. But that which comes up clo≈øe to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and which, I think, is the fulle≈øt and true≈øt An≈øwer, is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Civil Magi≈øtrate has nothing to do to enquire or regard how the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øtands between God and the Con≈øcience of the Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor of the Law of the Land; ≈øo as to be thereby any way influenced in the Pa≈ø≈øing his Judgment.</hi> It is enough to him, if he be well and throughly convinced, that the Laws by which he acts are no way contrary to the known Law of God. There are many Ca≈øes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40650:56"/> a Man offends highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Law of God, in which the Civil Magi≈øtrate has no Power to inflict any Puni≈øhment on the Offender; becau≈øe the Fault which he may have committed, does not, it may be, any way tend to the damage or di≈øturbance of the Civil Society; Which, and which only, is committed to the Care of the Magi≈øtrate. Such, for Example, are many Acts of Covetou≈øne≈øs, or of Prodigality, and other Sins; again≈øt which it is not po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to provide by any Humane Laws. And, on the other ≈øide, There are ≈øome Ca≈øes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man may ≈øtand ab≈øolved before the Tribunal of God, and yet be very ju≈øtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40650:57"/> by the Magi≈øtrate. Thus, for in≈øtance, If a Man has committed Theft or Murther, and, upon a ≈øincere and hearty Repentance, has obtained the Pardon of his Sins from God; yet, neverthele≈øs, if ≈øuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon be accu≈øed, and legally convicted, of ≈øuch Crimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil Magi≈øtrate; He not only may, but ought to put the Law of the Land in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution agnin≈øt him, though he believes him to be ever ≈øo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; That it may be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto others. For, if this ought not to be done, every Malefactor, by a pretence of Repentance, (which cannot certainly be di≈øcovered by any but God,) might e≈øcape the La≈øh of the Law: By which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40650:57"/> Means all wicked Men would be encouraged to commit all ≈øorts of Crimes. Thus al≈øo when the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were commanded by God to conquer the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we read how they ≈øent Spies to make a Di≈øcovery of the Land, that they might the more ea≈øily invade it. Now it is mo≈øt certain, that the≈øe Spies did nothing but what they had God Almighty's Warrant for; and yet, if they had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any of the <hi>Canaaniti≈øh</hi> Magi≈øtrates, and legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of their De≈øign; Who doubts but that it had been lawful for them to have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed them, according to the Law of War, and the Law of Nations?

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40650:58"/>XXXVI. But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it will be objected, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate's Power, yet this Doctrine which here is taught, mu≈øt certainly defeat and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all that Authority with which the Church is endowed and inve≈øted. For, though the civil Magi≈øtrate has no more to look after but only the Peace and Pre≈øervation of the Common-Wealth; yet ≈øurely it is the Duty of the Church to take Cognizance of tho≈øe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted merely again≈øt the Law of God. But how can the Church call any Man to an Account for any Sin or Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, when a Man may plead for him≈øelf, That he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40650:59"/> thought it was his Duty; which Plea, if really true (and who but God can di≈øprove it?) is ≈øufficient according to this Doctrine, to ju≈øtifie him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and con≈øequently to indemnifie him from all Cen≈øures of the Church. To this I an≈øwer, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church <hi>(i. e.</hi> of a Chri≈øtian Society) is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: <hi>viz.</hi> Either that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority wherewith it is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted immediately by God, or that which is conferred on it by the civil Laws and Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Kingdom or Commonwealth. The latter of the≈øe is a civil Authority, though exerci≈øed by Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical Per≈øons, becau≈øe it is derived altogether from the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40650:59"/> civil Power, And therefore, the Con≈øideration of it mu≈øt be referred to what is but now ≈øaid touching the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate. But as for that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is given to the Church immediately by God; it is evidently no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> An Authority to preach the Go≈øpel, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade Men every where to receive it; and an Authority to exclude tho≈øe Men out of the Society (that is, out of the vi≈øible Communion of it) who do not profe≈øs the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Faith, and live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Chri≈øtian Law. Other Authority than this does not appear to be given to the Church by God. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I have ≈øaid, does in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40650:60"/> the lea≈øt tend to abridge them any way as to the Exerci≈øe of this Power. <hi>The Church may and ought to preach the Go≈øpel, and per≈øwade men to embrace it. And however any Man may be excu≈øed before God by invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Ignorance, yet he is not to be ≈øuffered in the vi≈øible Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, if he does not believe and live as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian.</hi>

                  <p n="37">XXXVII. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it may be objected that I have ≈øeveral times in this Di≈øcour≈øe made u≈øe of a Di≈øtinction, which Di≈øtinction is neverthele≈øs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd altogether u≈øele≈øs and impertinent by the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign of the Di≈øcour≈øe it ≈øelf.

To which, the Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> do exactly agree, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. to <hi>Ver≈ø.</hi> 7. of the Second Chapter. And the ≈øame St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a Caution, That <hi>Philo≈øophy</hi> ≈øhould not corrupt our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. And warns <hi>Timothy</hi> again≈øt <hi>Science, fal≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ≈øo called, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. But there is nothing ≈øo much as intimated throughout the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> that Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or any other Humane Learning, will qualifie a Man ever the better, to become a Chri≈øtian. I confe≈øs, indeed, That, as things ≈øtand at this time in the World, it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40650:65"/> highly convenient that the Teachers and Preachers of Chri≈øtianity ≈øhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently skilled in Humane Learning; that they may be the better able to defend their Religion, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, again≈øt tho≈øe who u≈øe ≈øo much Art and Skill, either to corrupt, or oppo≈øe it. But where a Man ≈øets up, not for a Teacher, but only for a true Believer, it is evident, from what has been ≈øaid, that he has no need of Scholar≈øhip; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a plain and ≈øober Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, to make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all nece≈ø≈øary In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a good Chri≈øtian. Or el≈øe, Why ≈øhould the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel be preached ≈øo particularly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40650:65"/> to the <hi>Poor, Matth.</hi> 11. 5. who are commonly illiterate? And how ≈øhould the <hi>Poor in this World</hi> become ≈øo <hi>rich of Faith,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. From whence I think I may conclude, That <hi>all ≈øuch Doctrines, the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding and Proof whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend either on the ≈øubtile Spc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Humane Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or the Niceties and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici≈øms of Grammatical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the curious Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Hi≈øtory and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are not to be e≈øteemed as nece≈ø≈øary Parts of Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>

                  <p n="42">XLII. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is no le≈øs evident to me, that the main De≈øign of Je≈øus, and of his Di≈øciples, whom he ≈øent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40650:66"/> to preach the Go≈øpel, was, to make Men, not wi≈øer as to Matters of Speculation; but better, and more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to their Lives and Actions. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up; but Charity edi≈øieth,</hi> ≈øaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. Thus al≈øo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. of the ≈øame Epi≈øtle, he gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that the Gift of <hi>Tongues</hi> and of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the Under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all <hi>My≈øteries,</hi> and all <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> are of no value before God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Charity.</hi> And that by Charity, he means a Life led in the Practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, ≈øu≈øficiently appears by the Sequel of that Chapter. The ≈øame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. That <hi>the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40650:66"/> Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men;</hi> (For what End? To make them more wi≈øe, more learned, or more lo≈øty in their Speculations? No ≈øuch thing: But,) <hi>teaching us, That, denying <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ngodline≈øs, and Worldly Lu≈øts, we ≈øhould live ≈øoberly, righteou≈øly, and Godly in this pre≈øent World.</hi> And, to omit a multitude of Texts, which might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in ≈øo plain a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I ≈øhall only add what we are told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6, &amp;c. That God <hi>will render unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man according to his Deeds, &amp;c.</hi> Which is a plain Demon≈øtration, that it is our <hi>Deeds,</hi> that is, our Practices, our Live and Conver≈øations,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40650:67"/> that we are chiefly obliged to take care of. I grant, indeed, that God may, if he plea≈øes, command things that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonial, and ≈øuch as have no manner of Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vertue and Morality; As undoubtedly he did unto the Children of <hi>I≈ørael:</hi> And if he does command any ≈øuch things, 'tis certain that we owe Obedience to them by virtue of that Authority which God has over us. He may al≈øo reveal ≈øuch Truths as are merely ≈øpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and have nothing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical in them: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever is convinced of any ≈øuch Revelation, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly bound to give his A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to the things ≈øo revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40650:67"/> although they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Reach of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding; (as I have ≈øaid, ¬ß. 33.) But from what I have here ≈øaid, I think I may conclude, That <hi>≈øince Vertue and Morality are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the chief De≈øign of Chri≈øtianity, they ought to be chiefly regarded, and attended to by all Chri≈øtians. Nor ought any thing which is purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, or Speculative, to be reckoned as a nece≈ø≈øary Part of Chri≈øtian Religion; except it appears very evidently, that God has revealed, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. Very evidently,</hi> I ≈øay: For, when a thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in dark and doubtful Expre≈ø≈øions, it is very liable to be mi≈øtaken; and he that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40650:68"/> is guilty of ≈øuch a Mi≈øtake, can very hardly be charged with a Fault.</p>
                  <p n="43">XLIII. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Knowledge of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Attributes, and his Law, may, in part, be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (antecedent to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) is evident from Rea≈øon, and acknowledged by St. <hi>Paul. For the invi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ≈øeen, being under≈øtood by the things that are made; even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Rom. 1. 20. <hi>(See</hi> P≈øal. 19. 1. ) And <hi>when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by Nature the thiugs contained in the Law, the≈øe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40650:68"/> having not the Law, are a Law unto them≈øelves; which ≈øhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience al≈øo bearing Witne≈øs, and their Thoughts the mean while accu≈øing or el≈øe excu≈øing one another,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. Now although all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Religion, which may be known by the Light of Nature, are, I think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated and farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Yet becau≈øe it may be that this will not appear ≈øo plainly to every one, I think it nece≈ø≈øary here to Note, That <hi>we are obliged to give our A≈ø≈øent to tho≈øe Truths, and our Obedience to tho≈øe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40650:69"/> Laws of of Religion which we are able to di≈øcover by our Natural Rea≈øon, although the ≈øame ≈øhould not appear to us to be again repeated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For, for this very rea≈øon St. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounces the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Gentiles to be <hi>without Excu≈øe, becau≈øe that when they knew God,</hi> that is, had ≈øome Knowledge of him by their natural Under≈øtanding, <hi>they glorified him not as God,</hi> by owning and obeying him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is it el≈øe but an Appeal to the natural Notions of Mankind, when he exhorts us, That <hi>what≈øoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever things are hone≈øt, what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are ju≈øt, what≈øoever
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40650:69"/> things are pure, what≈øoever things are Lovely, what≈øoever things are of good Report, if there be any Vertue, and if there be any Prai≈øe, we ≈øhould think on the≈øe things,</hi> Phil. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="44">XLIV. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He that writes a Treati≈øe upon any Subject, what≈øoever he has a Mind that his Reader ≈øhould particularly ob≈øerve and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, he will be ≈øure to lay it down plainly as a main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion; nor will he fail (if he be di≈øcreet) as often as Occa≈øion requires, to repeat and referr to it, that the more Notice may be taken of his Meaning and De≈øign. Such things as are mentioned only occa≈øionally and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40650:70"/> and not as any part of the main Subject of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, are not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed with ≈øo much Care and Exactne≈øs, but that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten even the meaning of them may be mi≈øunder≈øtood.

From
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40650:70"/> whence I think I may conclude, That <hi>the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary Doctrines and Precepts of Chri≈øtian Religion, are not to be gachered from tho≈øe collateral and occa≈øional Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions which are ≈øcattered up and down in the Scriptures; but from the main Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign of the whole Bible in general, and of each Book of it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>

                  <head>A Short PREFACE To the whole.</head>
                  <p>SOme Men ≈ølight Religion, whil≈øt others corru and perplex it with things either fal≈øe or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary; the later of
<pb facs="tcp:40650:75"/> which I look upon to be much the cau≈øe of the former.</p>
                  <p>Many will not take the pains to read much; and many do not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con≈øider, nor will dige≈øt what they read; which renders their Notions confu≈øed, and them≈øelves uncertain what to conclude.</p>
                  <p>I have there≈øore
<pb facs="tcp:40650:75"/> endeavoured to make ≈øuch a ≈øhort and ea≈øy Draught of Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Grounds of it, as every Man of a moderate Capacity may read without Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou≈øne≈øs, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand without Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And which, if it does not wholly ≈øatisfie him, may yet ≈øerve to put his Thoughts into
<pb facs="tcp:40650:76"/> a Method, and him≈øelf upon ≈øeeking for farther Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt Part of this ≈ømall Work I put forth ≈øome time ≈øince; and, finding that it has not proved altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unacceptable to Men of Judgment and Moderation, I have been encouraged to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh and publi≈øh the
<pb facs="tcp:40650:76"/> Second and Third Parts al≈øo.</p>
                  <p>My De≈øign is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly good; and if I have not well performed what I have undertaken, I hope at lea≈øt that what I have here done, may move ≈øome more able and Judicious Per≈øon to take the Work in hand, and ≈øupply tho≈øe Defects of which I have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <head>Being the Second PART.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Holy Scriptures</hi> being the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Record that I am able to find of the Chri≈øtian Religion, I take it for granted that they <hi>do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Divine Matters really and truly as the things are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves:</hi> And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40650:79"/> but believe that all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin therein delivered is mo≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly true, altho many times I am not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the De≈øign and. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ≈øome Expre≈ø≈øions and Pa≈ø≈øages which do occur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I think it indeed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper, that Men of any rea≈øonable Learning and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ≈øhould mode≈øtly offer their Thoughts to the World, in order to the explaining of ≈øuch Places of the Scriptures as appear to be ab≈øtru≈øe and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: <hi>But he who ≈øpeaks his own Words</hi> (and not tho≈øe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>can therein only offer his own Apprehen≈øions;</hi> to which no Man can be obliged to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe, any farther than as he is in his own Rea≈øon convinced
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40650:79"/> of the Truth of them, and their Con≈øonancy with the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I do not apprehend that an implicit Faith is due to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges it (Part 1. ¬ß. 21.) much le≈øs ≈øure to any other Church which does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. <hi>When,</hi> therefore, <hi>any Church, much more when any private Men, do offer me any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Religion in their own Words, I think I ought to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Fir≈øt, <hi>Whether what they ≈øay is intelligible:</hi> (For tho we may be obliged to believe ≈øuch things as are above our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding to comprehend, (Part 1. ¬ß. 33.) yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible for any Man to give an explicit A≈ø≈øent to any Form
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:80"/> of Words, if he does not Know the meaning of them.) Secondly, <hi>Whether it is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ≈øelf-evident Principles of Rea≈øon,</hi> for, If I apprehend it to be otherwi≈øe, it is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible for me to believe it. (Part 1. ¬ß. 33.) Nor mu≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Text of Scripture be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted above the Level of plain and ≈øelf-evident Rea≈øon, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the literal Sen≈øe may ≈øeem to be. <hi>And,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>whether the Truth of it can be proved by any ≈øolid Argument,</hi> either from Rea≈øon or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for tho a Doctrin be both intelligible and po≈ø≈øible, yet ≈øtill it may be fal≈øe; and therefore is not to be believed except it can be proved. The≈øe Rules I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:80"/> ≈øtrictly to ob≈øerve in the Trial of tho≈øe Doctrins which I am now about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe; and I de≈øire my Reader carefully to make u≈øe of the ≈øame, in the Examination of all that I ≈øhall offer unto him. But here I mu≈øt de≈øire him to take notice, that I do fuppo≈øe him to be well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, and al≈øo with the common Arguments, upon which the ≈øeveral Parties of Chri≈øtians do ground and maintain their Opinions: And therefore, for his Ea≈øe, as well as my own, I ≈øhall ≈øave my ≈øelf the Labour of mentioning ≈øuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Places of Scripture, as are u≈øually brought to prove tho≈øe Points which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40650:81"/> acknowledged by all Chri≈øtians, and even in tho≈øe Points which are controverted between different Parties, I ≈øhall ordinarily think it enough to hint at ≈øome of tho≈øe Texts, and Arguments, which are u≈øed on either ≈øide; of which I can ≈øcarce ≈øuppo≈øe any Man to be ignorant that is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately acquainted with the Principles of Chri≈øtianity, and the ≈øeveral Parties that profe≈øs it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To believe what God makes known, and to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is</hi> what all Men call <hi>Religion:</hi> But things that are impo≈ø≈øible, 'tis certain that God requires from no Man (Part 1. ¬ß. 14.) <hi>When</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Damnation is denounced</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:81"/> in Scripture <hi>again≈øt tho≈øe who receive not the Go≈øpel, it mu≈øt needs be under≈øtood only of them in who≈øe Power it was to have received it;</hi> and not of ≈øuch who are invincibly ignorant; either for want of Capacity, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. or of the means of Knowledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. But for a Man who has both the Capacity and Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, through Negligence, to continue in Ignorance of God's Will, my Rea≈øon tells me is a very great Sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides all tho≈øe Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which do require us dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ≈øeek after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That <hi>there is a God,</hi> is ≈øufficiently to be proved from our own Rea≈øon and Ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:82"/> 
                     <hi>But fully to comprehend his Nature,</hi> or declare in all Points what he is, <hi>is by all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be impo≈ø≈øible to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That <hi>God never had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> I think I have ≈øufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded (Part 1. ¬ß. 6.) And, if the holy Scripture had not told me that he is from Everla≈øting to Everla≈øting; yet my own Rea≈øon would have inferred that <hi>he is ≈øubject to no Decay, nor ever ≈øhall have an Ending.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Nature of every Material Being ≈øeems nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to imply a Po≈ø≈øibility of having its Parts disjoyned and ≈øeparated one from another; and con≈øequently of being di≈ø≈øolved and de≈øtroyed: And there≈øore I conclude, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:82"/> eternal <hi>God does not con≈øi≈øt of Matter;</hi> and that Being which is intelligent, and does not con≈øi≈øt of any material Parts, I call a Spirit: And this is what I mean when I ≈øay that <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> As for tho≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions <hi>the Eyes of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Arm of the Lord,</hi> and ≈øuch like, which do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ≈øometimes in Scripture, and ≈øeem to imply Bodily Parts, it is manife≈øtly obvious that they mu≈øt be purely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our Experience does ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently te≈øtifie that what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is vi≈øible to us, is ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Since therefore <hi>God</hi> does not con≈øi≈øt of Matter, I conclude that he <hi>is invi≈øible to Mortal Eyes,</hi> as the Scripture
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:83"/> po≈øitively declares him to be: And all tho≈øe Texts which ≈øeem to ≈øay, that he has been ≈øeen by Man, I think mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be interpreted ≈øome other way, <hi>viz.</hi> either, 1. Of an Angel appearing in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and maje≈øtatick manner: Or 2. Of the eternal Son of God a≈ø≈øuming a Bodily Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as after he took our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him: Or, 3. Of ≈øome vi≈øible and extraordinary Signs and Tokens that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øible God was there pre≈øent in an extraordinary Manner: Or, 4. Of tho≈øe my≈øtical and Hieroglyphical Repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God has ≈øometimes been plea≈øed to make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, not to the Sen≈øes, but to the Imagination and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:83"/> of his Prophets, in their extatick Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Among≈øt all tho≈øe things which I can conceive po≈ø≈øible to be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> to imply no Contradiction, I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which to me appears more difficult, than what God has already done in the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Univer≈øe: And therefore I conclude, that <hi>God</hi> can do what≈øoever in its ≈øelf is po≈ø≈øible to be done, which is what I mean when I ≈øay, that <hi>he is Almighty:</hi> Nor is there any one, ≈øure, who will venture to ≈øay, that God can do ≈øuch things as imply a Contradiction, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, or to his own Nature and Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:84"/>9. That God, who made all things, ≈øhould be ignorant of any thing, appears to me mo≈øt ab≈øurd to imagine. But when I ≈øay, that <hi>God is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øcient;</hi> If there is any thing, the Knowledge of which would manife≈øtly imply a Contradiction, it could ≈øurely be no greater Irreverence to ≈øay, that God could not know, than that he could not do ≈øuch a thing. But whether the Knowledge of a future Contingent would imply a Contradiction or not, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ab≈øtru≈øe and metaphy≈øical Di≈øpute; and except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary can very clearly be made appear, I know not how to imagine that God is, or can be ignorant of any thing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:84"/> pa≈øt, pre≈øent, or to come, however contingent.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If God were or could be confined to, or circum≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in any determinate Space or Place, it would be hard to conceive that his Knowledge and Power ≈øhould be infinite, and extend to all Places. But I cannot ≈øuppo≈øe God to be pre≈øent in all Places a≈øter the ≈øame manner, as the Air is every where pre≈øent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Region, or the Light throughout its Hemi≈øphere, for that would imply local Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øion; and con≈øequently, that he were a material Being, contrary to what I have ≈øaid, ¬ß. 6. But that God can in an in≈øtant exert his Power in any, or all Places, whenever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40650:85"/> (as the Soul can on a ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den move the extreame≈øt Joynt of the Body) is, I think, an evident Con≈øequence of his Omnipotence; and that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Exi≈øtence whereby he is able to do this, I call Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øence; and this is all that I am able to conceive when I ≈øay that <hi>God is every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. That <hi>God is mo≈øt wi≈øe,</hi> that is to ≈øay, mo≈øt perfectly knows what is always fitte≈øt and be≈øt to be done, and which is the propere≈øt way to bring what he plea≈øes to pa≈øs, is an evident Con≈øequence from his Omni≈øcience, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed a Branch of it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. From God's Wi≈ødom it nece≈ø≈øarily follows, that his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:85"/> 
                     <hi>Coun≈øel is unchangeable.</hi> For he who alters or repents of any thing, which he has once po≈øitively determined, plainly ≈øhews his Fore≈øight to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and his Wi≈ødom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. When therefore we meet with ≈øome Pa≈ø≈øages in Scripture which ≈øeem to ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt that God has decreed one thing, and yet afterwards done another; we mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under≈øtand ≈øuch Decrees to have been not ab≈øolute, but merely conditional (a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being in many Ca≈øes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and ≈øuppo≈øed, where it is not in Words expre≈ø≈øed.) And when he is ≈øaid to have repented of ≈øome things which he has done, or to have been grieved thereat, we mu≈øt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40650:86"/> needs interpret ≈øuch Places in a metaphorical Sen≈øe, with an Allu≈øion to tho≈øe Motions and Pa≈ø≈øions in Mankind; ju≈øt as <hi>Hands, Arms, Eyes, &amp;c.</hi> are on the ≈øame account ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a≈øcribed unto him, tho really he has no ≈øuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, no more than he has the Pa≈ø≈øions, which belong to Men.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I do mo≈øt evidently find in my ≈øelf a Power to choo≈øe at all times what I plea≈øe, and to determine my own Actions as I will my ≈øelf: And this I look upon to be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection in me, than if I were ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øitated and determined by ≈øomewhat without my ≈øelf, in every thing which I ≈øhould do.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40650:86"/> Since therefore I derive this Perfection originally from God, who is the Contriver and Author of my Being, (Part 1. ¬ß. 7.) I cannot but a≈øcribe the ≈øame in the highe≈øt Degree to him, who mu≈øt be the Fountain of all Perfection. And therefore I mo≈øt readily believe that <hi>God is a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi> and worketh all things after the Coun≈øel of his own Will.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. How Ju≈øtice, in a ≈øtrict Sen≈øe, is to be a≈øcribed unto God, who ows nothing to any one, and has a ≈øupreme and mo≈øt ab≈øolute Dominion over all things, as having made them purely at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Will, I look upon to be a nice and u≈øele≈øs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40650:87"/> Di≈øqui≈øition: But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Ju≈øtice, which Men are obliged to ob≈øerve one to another, to me do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ≈øo very rea≈øonable, that I cannot apprehend why any one, of Knowledge and Under≈øtanding, ≈øhould ever va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from them, except there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might propo≈øe either to advance his Intere≈øt, compa≈øs his Plea≈øure, or wreck his Malice; neither of which I can imagine to have any Place in God. I therefore conclude that <hi>God is Ju≈øt,</hi> even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common Rules of Ju≈øtice and Equity, as far as they can be applied to him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Veracity to me appears to be no le≈øs agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40650:87"/> than Ju≈øtice, if it be not rather a Part of it: And ≈øince I am able to imagin no Shadow of a Rea≈øon why God ≈øhould declare any thing which were fal≈øe; I cannot but believe that <hi>he is mo≈øt true</hi> in all that he ≈øays.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That God ≈øhould hate tho≈øe Creatures which he has made (except they by their evil Actions and Di≈øobedience do de≈øerve it) is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And as he who loves another is always ready to pardon his Faults (e≈øpecially if they have any way proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only from Frailty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity) upon his true and ≈øincere Repentance; ≈øo if the Per≈øon beloved continues ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinate and incorrigible in his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40650:88"/> Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, he, with all the Rea≈øon that can be, ≈øor≈øeits that Love which he once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and ju≈øtly incurs ≈øuch Penalty as may be ≈øuitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Obligations which he has broken, and the Quality of the Per≈øon he has offended.

If therefore the Holy Scripture had given me no manner of a≈ø≈øurance of the perpetuity of

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40650:130"/> make the greater impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion upon his mind, when he is ≈øatisfied, as to the rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablene≈øs of it, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its obligation; I ≈øhall endeavour, as I proceed, fir≈øt to infer as much of our Duty as I can, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and circum≈øtances of Things and Per≈øons; and then to ≈øuperadd, where there is occa≈øion, what God has po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ordained and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to any point; And this with the ≈øame conci≈øene≈øs that I have ob≈øerved in my Second Part, neither enlarging upon tho≈øe Arguments, nor recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho≈øe Texts of Scripture, which I ≈øuppo≈øe my Reader to be able to call to mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lea≈øt hint of them,</p>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40650:130"/>2. To begin then: Since <hi>God</hi> is the mo≈øt perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being in Him≈øelf; and ≈øo loving and beneficent to Us, It follows, that <hi>we ought to love him in the highe≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that po≈ø≈øibly we can;</hi> And true and compleat Love, as it is an act of one per≈øon exerted towards another, as its object, con≈øi≈øts in an un≈øeigned de≈øire, Fir≈øt, of always doing what may be truly grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the per≈øon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; and Secondly, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and being with him as much as may be. The more ardent and zealous we are in our love to God, the better undoubtedly it is; And we ≈øhould ≈øtrive to engage our Affections, as well as our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40650:131"/> and our Will, unto him from whom we have received all things: But yet this Love is not to be mea≈øured, or judged of, by the earne≈øtne≈øs of tho≈øe ≈øuddain motions, which ≈øometimes may ari≈øe within us, upon the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God's Excellency and Goodne≈øs; becau≈øe to be thus <hi>Pa≈ø≈øionately</hi> affected is not wholly in our Power; and ≈øomtimes lea≈øt ≈øo, when we mo≈øt earne≈øtly de≈øire it. But the true and certain way of judging whether we love God, or not, is by examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ≈øtedfa≈øt in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutions, and accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in our Endeavours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly to obey him, and keep all his Commandments;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40650:131"/> which is the only way to plea≈øe, and con≈øequently to enjoy and for ever be with him: And where the Love of God is thus firmly rooted in the <hi>Will,</hi> and brings forth plenty of Fruit in the life and actions, it is certainly never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs acceptable to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it does not ≈øo pa≈ø≈øionately move our Affections as we could wi≈øh or de≈øire: And as all the Duties which we owe unto Almighty God, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from, and do depend upon that, of loving of him; or rather indeed are contained in it, ≈øo is it very evident, that they are all to be judged of by the ≈øame forementioned Rule; that is to ≈øay, not ≈øo much by the ≈øtrength of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40650:132"/> Impul≈øe upon the Mind (which is a thing not under our Command) as by the ≈øteady agreeablene≈øs of our Will and Actions, unto all ≈øuch Principles, as are right and good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Since God is the mo≈øt excellent and perfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently the mo≈øt worthy, of all Beings, that are, or can be; from hence it will follow, that <hi>we ought to honour him with the greate≈øt Honour that may be.</hi> Now to honour any per≈øon is, in other words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to e≈øteem, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to ≈øhew our Re≈øpect to him. Our inward E≈øteem of God con≈øi≈øts in a due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Being and Attributes; and our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40650:132"/> Re≈øpect to him, is to be ≈øhewn, as well by ab≈øtaining from all actions which may ≈øavour of any Neglect or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence towards him, as by performing all ≈øuch as may appear to be ≈øuitable, both to his own Excellency and our Dependence upon him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Since God is pre≈øent in all places, and knows all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the mo≈øt ≈øecret things; and therefore cannot po≈ø≈øibly be deceived, or impo≈øed on; <hi>We ≈øhould,</hi> on this con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>be very watchful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, upon all occa≈øions, how we behave our ≈øelves in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence:</hi> And, methinks, it is a mo≈øt ≈øhameful and deplorable thing, that Men commonly ≈øcruple, not to do tho≈øe things

                  <p n="5">5.

But the true e≈øtimate of ≈øuch belief is not to be made by the clearne≈øs and ≈øtrength of our ≈øpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive A≈ø≈øent unto tho≈øe Truths, which he has propo≈øed to our Under≈øtanding (for to receive a Truth without any Doubts or Scruples, which ≈øometimes do unaccountably force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves upon us, even in the cleare≈øt ca≈øes, is not always in

                  <p n="6">6. Since God's Power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and his Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable; it follows, that <hi>we ought to fear him</hi> (and ≈øo much the more, becau≈øe of our natural propen≈øity to ≈øin) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he has it always in his Power to make us mi≈øerable here, and eternally ≈øo hereafter.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40650:134"/> God, who always takes the greate≈øt care not to offend him; the Fear of him being never originally de≈øigned to torment and di≈øquiet our Minds, but only to be ≈øuch a Check upon us, as to keep us in due Awe and Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Since every ≈øin is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, both again≈øt a gracious and a powerful God, and of every dangerous con≈øequence to the per≈øon who commits it; And ≈øince nothing can po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly be concealed from God, it follows, that <hi>we ought to be</hi> deeply concerned, and <hi>truly ≈øorrowful for every ≈øin which we commit, and</hi> by no means to palliate or frame Excu≈øes for them, but <hi>freely to own and confe≈øs them to him.</hi> But the

                  <p n="8">8. Since God is Almighty, he is certainly able; and ≈øince he loves us, he cannot but be willing, to do every thing that is be≈øt and fitte≈øt for us, if we, by our own faults, do not provoke him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,

                  <p n="9">9. But ≈øince God is a free Agent, and ≈øince all the good which we have, or are capable of, comes from him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends altogether on his Power and over-ruling Providence; <hi>we ought to pray to him for what≈øoever we ≈øtand in need of;</hi> and that he would ble≈øs all our hone≈øt Labours with ≈øucce≈øs.

                  <p n="10">10.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40650:139"/> Fidelity. Now many times the be≈øt, or indeed the only, ≈øecurity which can be given in ≈øuch ca≈øes, is a ≈øolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Almighty God (who is the Searcher of all Hearts, and the Puni≈øher of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs) as expecting and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering one's ≈øelf to his Wrath and Vengeance, in ca≈øe he prevaricates in what he a≈ø≈øerts or promi≈øes: And this is what we call by the Name of an Oath. And ≈øince he who takes an Oath (I mean with due ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration) does therein make an evident acknowledgment of ≈øome of the principal Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; <hi>viz.</hi> his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, Ju≈øtice, Truth, and Power; it follows that <hi>an

Nor can I apprehend that, that place contains an univer≈øal prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ≈øwearing what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: For, be≈øides that the very Context in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ver≈øe does mo≈øt evidently
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40650:140"/> limit the di≈øcour≈øe to ≈øuch Oaths as are purely voluntary, and therefore altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nece≈ø≈øary; There is neither Rea≈øon nor Precedent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any one to believe that our Saviour would univer≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid any thing which has nothing of Evil or Malignity in its nature: And ≈øome even of the be≈øt of Men, not only before, but ≈øince the coming of Chri≈øt, and even the Ble≈ø≈øed Angels them≈øelves, we are a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured in Scripture, have ≈øworn upon ≈øome occa≈øions with great ≈øolemnity.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40650:141"/> univer≈øally evil in its ≈øelf, but altogether the contrary: Nor did our Ble≈ø≈øed Saviour, that we can find, de≈øign to deprive Princes or Magi≈øtrates of any part of that lawful Power which they had over their Subjects before his coming; who, every where, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øted with a Right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting an Oath from Them, when it ≈øhould be nece≈ø≈øary, either for the peace and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Common-wealth, or for the ending of Differences between private parties. And as for that pa≈ø≈øage of St. <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. which is by ≈øome urged again≈øt ≈øwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any ca≈øe what≈øoever; It, being no more but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation of our Saviours
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40650:141"/> words which were ju≈øt now mentioned, needs no other An≈øwer than what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given. But ≈øince the very nature and de≈øign of an Oath is to invoke God, that thereby a Man may give a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance to another of his truth and fidelity; it follows, that <hi>to affirm any thing upon Oath, beyond what the Man, who ≈øwears, knows to be true; or not to perform what he has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath promi≈øed, is a ≈øin.</hi> And ≈øince he who impo≈øes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another by doubtful and equivocal words, does as much deceive him, as he who ≈øpeaks a down-right Fal≈øity; from hence it will follow, that ≈øuch <hi>a deceitful Oath is</hi> altogether as contrary to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40650:142"/> nature and de≈øign of an Oath, and con≈øequently as <hi>unlawful</hi> as a fal≈øe one. But altho <hi>an Oath lays an obligation upon a Man to do whatever he has ≈øworn,</hi> yet <hi>if a Man ≈øwears to do any thing which is a ≈øin,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ≈øome former Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under which he indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øably lyes to God or Man, <hi>he can not in this ca≈øe be obliged to keep his Oath,</hi> but is bound to repent of it. For, be≈øides that it is not rea≈øonable, that any mans own act ≈øhould free him from any Obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he lyes to another; it is plain, that an Oath can neither alter the nature of a ≈øin, nor make it lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. And ≈øince the de≈øign of an Oath in its own nature
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40650:142"/> is to oblige him to perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that takes it; and ≈øince the Name of God ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unnece≈ø≈øarily to be invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it follows, that <hi>where a Man ought not to keep an Oath, he ought, not on any account to take it.</hi>

Now to deduce all the particular branches of Virtue and Piety from the≈øe main Principles; and to ≈øhew how Morality is improved and refined by the Go≈øpel to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40650:166"/> the highe≈øt degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a thing not dificult to be done, but yet incon≈øi≈øtent with my de≈øigned Brevity: For which therefore I mu≈øt refer my Reader to ≈øome of tho≈øe Books of Chri≈øtian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein each Particular of our Duty is, at large, de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and pre≈ø≈øed.

But if Mankind were propagated only by the exerci≈øe of wild and wandering Lu≈øt, without confinement to any ≈øetled Rules or Laws; this would
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40650:167"/> bring in ≈øuch a Deluge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion and di≈øturbance, as would unavoidably deprive them of the greate≈øt part of tho≈øe ≈øatisfactions which at the pre≈øent they do, or may, enjoy. For if there were no ≈øuch thing as ≈øetled Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, we can hardly ≈øuppo≈øe that ever there would be any ≈øort of ≈øetled Families, which are the fir≈øt beginnings of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and regularity among≈øt Men; Fathers would not know which were their own Children, and con≈øequently would take no care to bring them up, or provide for them; and not only the pain of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the whole trouble of nouri≈øhing reating and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for Children, would
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40650:168"/> lie, wholly upon the Female Sex, who by them≈øelves could but very imperfectly perform that work as it ≈øhould be done. Since therefore God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Comfort and ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Men, even whil≈øt they are here upon Earth, I conclude, that it is his Will, that <hi>Mankind ≈øhould be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated no other way but by ≈øetled Marriages,</hi> that is, by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and Agreement between the Male and Female, and that under ≈øuch Rules as are fit and proper to promote the general Happine≈øs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which being his great de≈øign, ought ever al≈øo to be ours.</p>

                  <p n="48">48. But <hi>if the legi≈ølative Power of any Nation do enact any thing which is contrary to the expre≈øs Law of God, or the eternal Laws of good and evil; No particular Man can be bound to obey ≈øuch a Con≈øtitution.</hi> For the Authority of God ought to weigh more with us, than that of any Community what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever; And it is expres≈øly ruled in Scripture, that we ought to obey God rather than Man.</p>

The De≈øign of our Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who, at the Will of his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, in≈øtituted and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied the Chri≈øtian Church, was to purifie unto him≈øelf a peculiar People zealous of good works, or, in other terms, by this Incorporation ≈øo made, more effectually to promote the practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Godline≈øs in the World.

                  <p n="1">1. HOW tho≈øe Per≈øons who take unto them≈øelves the di≈øtingui≈øhing Name of <hi>Vnitarians</hi> do di≈ø≈øent from the main Body of <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever Church or Per≈øwa≈øion, touching the Doctrines of the Trinity, and the Incarnation of our Saviour Chri≈øt, is ≈øo well known, that I need not here offer to open or explain in the Terms of the Controver≈øie which is managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Now when in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpute the <hi>Vnitarians</hi> are pre≈øt with ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture, which ≈øeem very evidently to make again≈øt them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:215"/> be≈øides other ways which they have to avoid the force of them, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have recour≈øe to the nature of the thing controverted; and pre≈øs their Adver≈øaries back again with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How ≈øuch a thing can po≈ø≈øibly be? And when to this it is reply'd, That there is evidently no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ≈øound Rea≈øon in the Doctrines them≈øelves, and that the Truth of them ought ot be believed upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, who hath revealed them: But that the manner of them is utterly above, and altogether incomprehen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our finite and narrow Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings, and therefore not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after. In return to this, there are ≈øome who maintain, that if the≈øe Doctrines were not contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, yet this alone is a ≈øufficient cau≈øe to reject them, that they are confe≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above it. For of that which is above our Rea≈øon (≈øay they) we can form no true Conception, or Idea; and it is ab≈øurd, or rather impo≈ø≈øible for a Man to believe, that which he cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly ≈øo much as conceive or apprehend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the right ≈øtating and clearing of this whole Controver≈øie, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:215"/> ≈øuch hints in the <hi>Gentleman's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Part 1. Sect. 33. Part 2. 22, 23, 37. as I thought to be mo≈øt fit for Men of ordinary Capacity, and mo≈øt ≈øuitable to that brevity which I all along defigned. But in this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, I ≈øhall addre≈øs my ≈øelf unto tho≈øe, who are of a more refined Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accu≈øtomed to a more exact way of thinking; and try if I can give them any ≈øatisfaction in a Matter, which ≈øeems to be not a little perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perhaps by the overmuch Curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ≈øome of both the contending Parties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That our Knowledge of things is but ≈øhort and imperfect, is confe≈ø≈øed on all ≈øides.

But ≈øince, upon the ≈øtricte≈øt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have been able to make, I am my ≈øelf fully convinced of the Truth of what I have concluded in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpute, I will now (with God's A≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) try, whether I can expre≈øs my Thoughts with ≈øo much clearne≈øs, and prove them with ≈øuch ≈øufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pertinent In≈øtances, as may give ≈øome Satisfaction to others al≈øo: And that I may the more effectually do this, I ≈øhall endeavour to proceed as near as I can in ≈øuch a Method, as is always u≈øed. in Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This word <hi>Doctrine</hi> is but another Term for a <hi>Prope≈øition;</hi> and what a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition</hi> is, or when it is ≈øaid to be true or fal≈øe, certain, probable, or doubtful, I need not ≈øpend time to explain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> is that faculty in Man (for I meddle not with the Knowledge of Angels) whereby he apprehends, things, and their Attributes or Properties; and frames a Judgment concerning what he apprehends. And al≈øo from tho≈øe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:217"/> which he makes, draws ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more immediate, or more remote and di≈øtant Con≈øequences.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Truth of ≈øome Propo≈øitions is ≈øo very plain, that as no Man in his Sen≈øes can deny them, ≈øo is it impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find out any thing which is more plain whereby to prove them. And ≈øuch Propo≈øitions as the≈øe I call <hi>≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident:</hi> Such for Example are, That <hi>all the parts of a thing taken together are equal to the whole.</hi> That <hi>both parts of a Contradiction cannot be true at the ≈øame time;</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the Truth of a Propo≈øition does not immediately appear by its own light, but yet the Propo≈øition can, beyond que≈øtion, be proved from other Propo≈øitions which are ≈øelf-evident; ≈øuch a Propo≈øition as this I term to be <hi>built upon Rea≈øon alone.</hi> Such for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance are, That <hi>two Triangles, having equal ba≈øes, and being contained between the ≈øame parallel Lines, are equal;</hi> and all other Propo≈øitions which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being demon≈øtrated, or clearly proved from the bare Principles of Rea≈øon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Where the po≈ø≈øibility of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition <hi>(i. e.</hi> that it implyes no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:218"/> can be evidently proved from the Principles of Rea≈øon alone, but yet the actual Truth and Reality of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the ≈øame way be made appear, ≈øuch a Propo≈øition as this I call <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to Rea≈øon.</hi> Thus for Example; That <hi>an Oak ≈øhould grow up to its full and u≈øual Stature, in an hour,</hi> is as po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (that is to ≈øay, as free from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) as that it ≈øhould do the ≈øame in an hundred years; (for all growth is motion, and the ≈øwiftne≈øs of motion may be for ever increa≈øed) but that ever this was actually ≈øo, cannot be proved by any Arguments drawn from Rea≈øon.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Where any Propo≈øition (either immediately in it ≈øelf, or mediately in its Con≈øequences) does plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any other Propo≈øition which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øelf-evident, or built upon Rea≈øon, ≈øuch a Propo≈øition as this I term to be <hi>contrary to Rea≈øon;</hi> ≈øuch for Example is this Propo≈øition, That <hi>the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a Triangle are equal to three right Angles,</hi> and ≈øuch like.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where a Propo≈øition is in it ≈øelf true, but we are unable clearly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or frame a Notion or Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things contained under the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:218"/> terms of it, ≈øuch a Propo≈øition I term to be <hi>above Rea≈øon.</hi> And a Propo≈øition may be either wholly and altogether above our Rea≈øon, when we can frame no manner of Conception of the things ≈øpoken of, or el≈øe but partly above it, when ≈øome Notions of the things we have, but tho≈øe very ob≈øcure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Thus the Doctrine of Light and Colours, is wholly above the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of a Man born blind, who can frame no manner of Notion of the≈øe things from the De≈øcription which others make of them, becau≈øe he is altogether de≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of proper Organs to receive any Impre≈ø≈øion from the things them≈øelves. But the ≈øame Doctrine would not be ≈øo much above the Rea≈øon of a Man, who had ≈øome faint and confu≈øed glimmering of Sight; tho' ≈øtill much more above his Rea≈øon than it would be if he were endowed with the ≈øacul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of clear and di≈øtinct Sight, as other Men commonly are.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To <hi>know,</hi> is to give a≈ø≈øent to a Propo≈øition when it evidently appears to be built upon Rea≈øon. But when the Truth of a Propo≈øition is a≈ø≈øented to, not upon Arguments drawn from the Rea≈øon, or the Nature of the thing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:219"/> but upon account of the Veracity, and Authority of the Per≈øon or Per≈øons who affirm it; ≈øuch a Propo≈øition as that is ≈øaid to be <hi>believed.</hi> Furthermore, If a Man under≈øtands not the meaning of a Propo≈øition, and yet believes that it contains a Truth in it, becau≈øe of the deference he pays to the Per≈øon who ≈øpeaks it; this I call an <hi>implicit belief:</hi> And properly ≈øpeaking, the Object of ≈øuch a belief is not the Truth of the Propo≈øition it ≈øelf, but only the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Speaker. But where a Man under≈øtands the meaning of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition which he believes, this I call an <hi>Explicit Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>No Man can po≈ø≈øibly believe or give his A≈ø≈øent to any Doctrine or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition which appears to him to be contrary to Rea≈øon,</hi> (≈øee Sect. 9.) For to own a Propo≈øition to be ≈øelf-evident, or built upon Rea≈øon, and yet at the ≈øame time to believe another which mediately, or immediately, is contradictory to it, is ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>If a Propo≈øition be reconcilable to Rea≈øon,</hi> (Sect. 8.) and the Truth of it al≈øo te≈øtified by ≈øuch Per≈øons who≈øe Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is beyond all doubt, or exception; ≈øuch a Propo≈øition cannot but be believed by any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:219"/> 
                     <hi>one unto whom it comes ≈øo te≈øtified.</hi> For if it be reconcilable to Rea≈øon, then it may po≈ø≈øibly be true; <hi>(Sect.</hi> 8.) and if I am actually convinced of the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Per≈øon or Per≈øons, who relate it, I cannot choo≈øe but believe that it is True. From whence I think it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that Revelation, or the Te≈øtimony of another, may ju≈øtly be looked upon, not only as <hi>a means of Information,</hi> but al≈øo <hi>a motive of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øion,</hi> whatever a late Author ≈øays to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But that which is mo≈øt material in this pre≈øent Controver≈øie, is what I am now going to make appear, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>a Man may have mo≈øt ≈øufficient, and cogent Arguments, to give his A≈ø≈øent to ≈øuch Propo≈øitions as are not only in part, but wholly, and altogether above his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.</hi> (Sect. 10.) For the clear and plain evincing of which, I ≈øhall crave leave to make a Relation of a Conference which once I had with a blind Man; to whom, when I under≈øtood that he had been quite blind from his Infancy, and never could remember to have ≈øeen the lea≈øt glimmering of Light, I had the Curio≈øity to put ≈øeveral que≈øtions. I asked him fir≈øt of all, Whether ever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:220"/> he had endeavoured to frame any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conception, of Light or Colours, of which I ≈øuppo≈øe he had often heard mention to be made in common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcour≈øe? To which he an≈øwered me, That he had often endeavoured it with the greate≈øt Application of his Mind that po≈ø≈øibly he could. And to that end and purpo≈øe he had made it his Bu≈øine≈øs to ask all the que≈øtions he could think of, whereby to get Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but all to no purpo≈øe; for that he was ≈øtill altogether as ignorant of the Nature of Light and Colours, and as unable to frame any Conception of them, as if he had never before heard the Names of them. He told me moreover, that he was a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would, or could believe, that other Men had any faculty at all which he wanted. For, ≈øays he, I was ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of no Defect or Imperfection in my ≈øelf, but believed my ≈øelf to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as perfect as all other Men with whom I conver≈øed; and therefore when they told me that I was blind, and talked to me of Light and Colours, I apprehended for a great while, that they did it only to impo≈øe upon me. But are you now convinced, ≈øaid I,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:220"/> that you are blind; and that other Men have the faculty of Sight, which you want? Yes, replied he, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øatisfied and convinced of it. How can that be, ≈øaid I. when you can frame no manner of Notion of Light or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which are the Objects of Sight? Thus an≈øwered he, I was convinced of it: They would put me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance from them, and yet would tell me every thing that I did; as whether I ≈øtood, or ≈øate, or held up my Hand, or let it down, or the like: Whereas I could not not di≈øcover any thing which they did, except I were clo≈øe to them, and felt them carefully with my Hands. Now by this, continued he, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, that other Men have a faculty which I want, whereby they can di≈øcover and di≈øtingui≈øh things at a di≈øtance, which they call <hi>Sight:</hi> And I am told by all Men, that there is ≈øomething called <hi>Light,</hi> which is diffu≈øed through the Air, and is the In≈øtrument whereby they are enabled to exerci≈øe this faculty; and al≈øo that the <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Shape</hi> of things are the Objects upon which the ≈øame is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. But although I can by my touch di≈øtingui≈øh between the different
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40650:221"/> ≈øhapes of ≈øome things, and ≈øo can frame a Notion of <hi>Shape:</hi> Yet what <hi>Light</hi> is, or what <hi>Colours</hi> are, I have not the lea≈øt Conception; although I am, as I have told you, ≈øufficiently convinced, that ≈øome ≈øuch things there are. Now this Relation being (for the ≈øub≈øtance of it) true; to my own Knowledge, or at lea≈øt (as every Man will own it to be) po≈ø≈øible and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; it will evidently follow, without any farther proof, that this Man had very good and unque≈øtionable grounds to believe ≈øome things that were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether above his Rea≈øon; for what Sight, Light, or Colours were, he was utterly uncapable of framing, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, any Idea. But yet that there were ≈øuch things, and that all he heard Men di≈øcour≈øe about them was not meer Fiction, (as he for ≈øome time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) was plainly proved to him by ≈øuch Arguments as every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Man mu≈øt allow to have been abundantly ≈øufficient to move his A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent. Nor was this A≈ø≈øent of his which he gave unto the≈øe things, a bare impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Belief; <hi>(Sect.</hi> 11.) as if he had been told that ≈øomething did Exi≈øt, which was called <hi>Blictri;</hi> but was altogether
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:221"/> ignorant of what was ≈øignified by that word, (as Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> ≈øpeaks.) For ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible for him to frame any direct Notion, or Conception, of the things them≈øelves, yet by tho≈øe analogous Repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were made to him of them, he well might be, and was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only fully convinced, that what was ≈øpoken concerning them, was not in≈øignificant Non≈øen≈øe; but al≈øo enabled to frame ≈øome ≈øort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative Conception of them, which is more than a Man can do of <hi>Blictri;</hi> of which he hears only the ≈øound, but knows not the Signification. For, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing a Man at the very time of his Birth, to be utterly deprived of his Organs of Sight; yet, by the u≈øe of his other four Sen≈øes, he may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a faculty of Sen≈øation is; and how a ≈øen≈øible quality, or the ≈ømall Particles of Matter flowing, or rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Body, and ≈øtriking upon the proper Organ of Sen≈øe, do make ≈øuch a peculiar Impre≈ø≈øion upon it, as to affect our Under≈øtanding with ≈øome particular Knowledge of the Body it ≈øelf, whereby we are enabled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh it from other Bodies. And as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40650:222"/> he can directly apply all this to the Sen≈øes of Hearing, Smelling, Ta≈øting, and Touching, of which he may be as good, or a better Ma≈øter than other Men: So, by way of Analogy from the≈øe Sen≈øes, he will be able to make ≈øome imperfect ≈øort of Repre≈øentation to him≈øelf, what ≈øort of thing Sight is; and what Light, and Colours are; though directly, and particularly, he knows no more of them, than if he had never heard of them. Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> in his Treati≈øe of Bodies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. tells us of a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Noble Man, who was born ≈øo ab≈øolutely deaf, that if a Gun were ≈øhot off clo≈øe by his Ear, he could not hear it; and yet was taught to ≈øpeak very di≈øtinctly; and, by the motion of any Mans Mouth, ≈øo perfectly to under≈øtand what he ≈øaid, as that he would not lo≈øe a word in a whole days Conver≈øation. Now the Doctrine of Sounds and Mu≈øick mu≈øt of Nece≈ø≈øity have been as much above this Mans Rea≈øon, as that of Light and Colours, was above the blind Mans, of whom I but now ≈øpoke; and yet there might very good A≈ø≈øurance have been given to the one, that there was ≈øuch a Sen≈øe as Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40650:222"/> and ≈øuch a thing as a Sound, as well as there was unto the other, in the ca≈øe of Light and Colours.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And now to apply what has been ≈øaid, to the Controver≈øie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity, and Incarnation of our Saviour. And here the I≈ø≈øue which I am now trying, pre≈øuppo≈øes the≈øe three things: Fir≈øt, That the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove the Truth of the≈øe Doctrines, are ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the purpo≈øe for which they are alledged, if we interpret them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural Order, and u≈øual ≈øignification of the Words and Expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them. Secondly, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines them≈øelves are not contrary to Rea≈øon, as not implying any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; ≈øee <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. But Thirdly, That they are altogether above our Rea≈øon, becau≈øe we cannot frame any Notion or Idea of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Union, and Di≈øtinction, which is between the Three Per≈øons of the Ble≈ø≈øed Trinity, or between the two Natures which are in our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt: Which three things being taken for granted, the que≈øtion that is to be determined, is, Whether or no it be a ≈øufficient ground for a Man to deny his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40650:223"/> A≈ø≈øent to the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarnation of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe they are above his Rea≈øon?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And here, in the fir≈øt place, it is very plain, That although we cannot by any means comprehend the things them≈øelves, yet we do ≈øo far under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the meaning of the Terms in which the≈øe Doctrines are expre≈ø≈øed, as clearly to perceive that they are not a company of in≈øignificant Words put together, to make a ≈øound, and ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing. What a <hi>Per≈øon</hi> is, we know; though we cannot tell what ≈øort of Per≈øons the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho≈øt are; and how their Per≈øonal Di≈øtinction between them≈øelves, particularly and fully dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that of Men, one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What it is to be <hi>One,</hi> we well under≈øtand, although we cannot frame an Idea of that ≈øpecial Union which is between tho≈øe Divine Per≈øons. What it is for one being to <hi>generate</hi> another, and what to <hi>proceed</hi> from another, we are not ignorant; although the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner of the Generation of the Son of God, and the Proce≈ø≈øion of the Holy Gho≈øt, be beyond our Capacity to conceive. And La≈øtly, What it is for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40650:223"/> two Beings to be <hi>Vnited</hi> together, we can very well apprehend; although we pretend not to know the manner of That Union which is between the two Natures in the Per≈øon of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. From whence it plainly follows, That the≈øe Doctrines, though <hi>above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> do yet ≈øo far ≈øtand upon equal Terms with tho≈øe Doctrines which I have termed <hi>reconcilable to Rea≈øon, Sect.</hi> 8. That as our Rea≈øon may be plainly and po≈øitive convinced from its own Principles alone, of the <hi>po≈ø≈øibility</hi> of the one; ≈øo is there no Principle of our Rea≈øon which can reach ≈øo far as to prove or demon≈øtrate any <hi>impo≈ø≈øibility</hi> in the other. And where there is no Contradiction, or Impo≈ø≈øibility, in a Doctrine, it will undeniably follow, that that ≈øame Doctrine may po≈ø≈øibly be true. And where ever a Man is convinced of the po≈ø≈øibility of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if the Truth of that ≈øame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine appears to him to be re≈øtified by any Per≈øon, of who≈øe Veracity he cannot entertain any manner of doubt, he cannot refu≈øe to give his A≈ø≈øent to it; as I have ≈øaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Since then the Veracity of God admits of no manner of doubt, and the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40650:224"/> are by both Parties in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpute allowed of, as mo≈øt Authentick Records of the Doctrines of Faith, and Rules of Life, which God has made known, and revealed to the World. And la≈øtly, ≈øince we here ≈øuppo≈øe, that the Doctrine of the Trinity, and that of the Incarnation of Chri≈øt, do neither of them contain, or imply, any Impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Contradiction, although they are both of them above our Rea≈øon, it will follow, that if all, or any of the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove the≈øe Doctrines, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the common way of interpreting all Books, (of which ≈øee <hi>Part 1. Sect.</hi> 25.) do fairly (and without being wre≈øted) contain (either in them≈øelves, or their evident Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences) tho≈øe ≈øame Doctrines which they are alledged to e≈øtabli≈øh, there can be no ju≈øt Cau≈øe why any Man ≈øhould deny his A≈ø≈øent to them. But if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all this, it be ≈øtill urged, that it is not po≈ø≈øible for a Man expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to believe a thing of which he can frame no Conception or Idea; I mu≈øt refer him to the Story of the blind Man, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. which ≈øeems to me abundantly to evince the contrary.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40650:224"/> And why we ≈øhould not believe the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, upon the Te≈øtimony of the Holy Scriptures, as well as the blind Man did the Exi≈øtence of Light and Colours, upon the Te≈øtimony of other Men; joyned with that collateral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment which I have mentioned, I profe≈øs I can ≈øee no manner of Rea≈øon.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And as in my Book, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 71. I have adverti≈øed my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I have purpo≈øely avoided the u≈øe of certain Words and Terms, for the Rea≈øon there given: So mu≈øt I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire him to take notice, that for the like Rea≈øon, I have both in my Book, and in this Appendix, omitted ≈øo much as to mention the word <hi>My≈øtery,</hi> about which, ≈øo great a Noi≈øe has of late been made. Whether this ≈øame Term <hi>My≈øtery,</hi> be always u≈øed in the New Te≈øtament, in the very ≈øame (and no other) Signification as it is under≈øtood by Heathen Authors? Or, Whether other ≈øorts of things, by a very allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Analogy, are not al≈øo there called My≈øteries, upon account of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcurity; becau≈øe <hi>we know them but in part, and ≈øee</hi> them but <hi>as in a Gla≈øs darkly.</hi> Or, La≈øtly, Whether there be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40650:225"/> any thing in Chri≈øtianity, which may <hi>properly</hi> be called a <hi>My≈øtery,</hi> according to the genuine meaning of that Term; to me ≈øeems to be no more but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <hi>about a word,</hi> which the Apo≈øtle expre≈øly forbids. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. But whatever may be determined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propriety of the Word, the thing if ≈øelf ≈øeems to me, to be very evident, that there are ≈øome Doctrines in Chri≈øtianity, which are above our Rea≈øon, and yet that this is no ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for the denial of our A≈ø≈øent to them.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And if I am told, that after all this, there is no greater ob≈øcurity in any of the Doctrines of Chri≈øtianity, than what there is in all natural Beings, with which we mo≈øt familiarly conver≈øe; who≈øe <hi>real E≈ø≈øence</hi> we cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, but mu≈øt content our ≈øelves with a ≈øort of Superficial Knowledge of them, which is cau≈øed by tho≈øe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions which they make upon our outward Organs; which, at mo≈øt, can be termed but a <hi>nominal E≈ø≈øence;</hi> ≈øo that even <hi>a ≈øpire of Gra≈øs, a Stick, a Stone,</hi> or any other natural Being, may upon this account, as truly be termed <hi>My≈øtericus,</hi> as the mo≈øt ≈øublime Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40650:225"/> of Religion. I ≈øhall only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, that it mightily rai≈øes my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to hear Men ≈øo freely acknowledge, that in every other thing what≈øoever, there is ≈øomething which is above their Rea≈øon, and to which their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding cannot reach; and yet, that they will not allow the ≈øame in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But I know it will be objected, that the fir≈øt of tho≈øe three Suppo≈øitions which I have laid down, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. will by no means be granted by the <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> for they are ≈øo far from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarnation, to be any way ≈øufficient to that purpo≈øe; that on the contrary, they do, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt A≈ø≈øurance, undertake to bring other and contrary Interpetations of tho≈øe very Pa≈ø≈øages, which they pretend to be far more Rational and Natural. To which I ≈øhall only An≈øwer, that this is all that I aim at in this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, that the I≈ø≈øue of the≈øe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies may be placed upon that which is the only true Foundation for it; I mean, the Authority of the Holy Scriptures; and that blind Men would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40650:226"/> not take upon them, by the ≈øtrength of their Rea≈øon, to di≈øcu≈øs Problems, and frame Conclu≈øions concerning Light and Colours, of which they can have no true or ≈øufficient Idea. I am very ≈øen≈øible that learned Men, who have their Minds ≈øtrongly prepo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with any Opinion, may, by their Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici≈øms, and Paraphra≈øes, and ≈øuch like Engines, torture and ≈øcrew almo≈øt any Text of Scripture, till they make it look with another A≈øpect from what is truly its own, and ≈øeem to confe≈øs what really it never thought or meant. But if we would always take tho≈øe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations which flow of them≈øelves, and not tho≈øe which are violently pre≈ø≈øed from the Scripture, (which I think is the faire≈øt way of expounding all Speeches and Di≈øcour≈øes what≈øoever) I cannot, for my part, ≈øee how we can otherwi≈øe conclude, concerning the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than as I have done, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. 37.</p>
