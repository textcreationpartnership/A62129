            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PART I.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. SInce almoſt all Men (however different in other Opinions and Intereſts) have ever agreed in this, That there is a God, to whoſe Power all Things are ſubject; That the true Service and Worſhip of God (which is called Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40650:4"/> ſhall be rewarded with Future Happineſs; and, That the Neglect and Contempt of Religion ſhall be puniſhed with Future Miſery; Every Man ſurely has reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus much at leaſt, That what is ſo generally and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed may be poſſibly, nay and is probably, a Truth. And whereſoever there is a poſſibility, and much more where there is a probability, of a great Good on the one hand, and a great Evil on the other; there certainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is contented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the reality of the thing; that he may not miſs of the one, if it be attainable, nor fall into the other, if it be avoidable. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40650:4"/> That <hi>it is a very great folly for any Man to give over ſearching after the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, untill he has found it; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were able to demonſtrate, either that there is no God; or elſe, that there is no Worſhip or Service due to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. In all Matters of great and ſerious Conſequence, no Man that is wiſe, will act by chance, and at random, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give ſome Reaſon for what he does. For he that does any thing, and knows not why, is more likely to do himſelf Hurt than Good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are more Ways to the former, than to the latter. Since therefore Religion is a thing of the greateſt Moment and Importance that can be,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:5"/> I conclude, that <hi>no Man ought to chuſe his Religion blindly, and by chance; but that every Man ought to have ſome Reaſon for what he profeſſes. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Religion,</hi> therefore, <hi>a Man is bred up in from his Youth, it certainly is very fit for him, when he comes to Years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to enquire into the Grounds and Reaſons of it.</hi> For otherwiſe it is not poſſible for him to know whether he be in the Right, or the Wrong; in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If there be a God, and if he requires any ſervice or worſhip <hi>(i. e.</hi> any Religion) from us, it is undoubtedly for this End, that it may be a Trial of our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Obedience to him.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:5"/> Now, whoſoever has a mind to prove his Servant, whether he will be faithful and obedient, he will not give him ſuch dark and intricate Commands, as ſhall puzzle him to find out the meaning of them; (For, how can a Servant approve himſelf faithful and obedient, if he be uncertain what it is that his Maſter requires from him?) But he will ſurely give him ſuch Commands and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as are eaſie enough to be underſtood, however dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult they may be to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprized, or accompliſhed. I conclude therefore, That <hi>all the Duties of Religion, which God requires of any Man, muſt needs be eaſie enongh for him to underſtand, however hard they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40650:6"/> may be to be practiſed.</hi> For, otherwiſe, Religion would be a Trial rather of a Man's Wit and Cunning, than of his Faithfulneſs and Obedience. And therefore alſo I cannot but conclude, That <hi>moſt,</hi> if not all the <hi>Controverſies about Religion,</hi> which at this Day diſtract the World, <hi>do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any Difficulty in or about the Determination of all things neceſſary in Religion it ſelf; but partly from the Pride of ſome Learned Men,</hi> who have loved to ſtrat new and difficult Queſtions, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their private Sentiments upon the World, that they might be admired for their Wit and Subtilty; <hi>partly from the Covetouſneſs and Ambition
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:6"/> of ſome,</hi> whether Learned, or Unlearned, who have found that their Worldly Intereſt will be better ſerved by ſome Doctrins (no matter how falſe and precarious) than by others; <hi>and partly from the Prejudice of moſt Men,</hi> who are apt, with great Zeal and Eagerneſs, to contend for all thoſe things which, from their Childhood, they have been taught to have a Reverence for. And I farther conclude, That <hi>whoſoever has a ſincere deſire to embrace True Religion, muſt lay aſide Pride, Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Prejudice,</hi> which would miſ-guide him; <hi>and follow his ſober and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Reaſon,</hi> which will ever lead him in the right Way.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:7"/>IV. There are different ſorts, or rather degrees of Aſſurance, which Men have concerning Things. Some things are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of themſelves, without any Proof; ſome things we are aſſured of, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our ſenſes; ſome things we receive as Truths, becauſe we find them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from other Truths alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received; and ſome things we believe only upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of others. Moreover, ſome things we are perſuaded of, without any Doubt or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; whereas other things do ſeem, at beſt, to be but likely or probable, and that too in a different degree, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their Evidence is ſtronger, or weaker. Now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:7"/> every ſober Man, where he has certain Evidence of a thing, there he acts with Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; where the Matter is but probable, there he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with Caution: But where a Man is under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of doing one way or other, and where the Matter appears doubtful on both ſides, there it becomes him to weigh the Reaſons on both parts with due Conſideration; and according as he finds the greater Probability to be on the one hand rather than the other, ſo to ſquare his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accordingly. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Man muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either live religiouſly or not live religiouſly; I conclude, that <hi>if upon a ſerious Conſideration
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:8"/> of the matter, there appear to be more probable Reaſons and Arguments for Religion than against it, every wiſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man muſt embrace Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> This I ſay, not but that I think there are even demonſtrative Arguments for Religion; and not ſo much as one probable one againſt it: But becauſe that which to me ſeems demonſtrative, to another may appear but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I thought it fit to note, That every Man in point of common Prudence is obliged to follow Religion, if it does but appear more likely and probable to him than Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Whether it is poſſible for any Agent to produce a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:8"/> new Being purely out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, may with much ſhew of Religion be doubted: As alſo Whether meer Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or efficient Cauſe, can ever be able to work it ſelf into any different Species or Forms. But this appears as certain as any thing can can be; That where there is neither any Agent or efficent Cauſe to work, nor any Matter or Subject to be wrought upon, there it is utterly impoſſible for any thing ever to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Being. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I find that there are many things which actually have a Being and Exiſtence, I conclude, That <hi>of abſolute neceſſity there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:9"/> or other which has been from all Eternity, and never had a Beginning.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we ſuppoſe that ever there was a time when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all did exiſt, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, from what has been ſaid, that it would be utterly impoſſible that any thing ever ſhould be produced into Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Since of neceſſity we muſt acknowledge ſomething to have been Eternal, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude, That <hi>the Eternity of ſuch a Being as God is deſcribed to be, is much more probable and fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, than the Eternity of ſuch a Being as I ſee this World to be.</hi> For when I go about to convince a Nation of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:9"/> Eternity of the World (I mean in the like Poſture that now it is in) there do occurr to my Mind ſuch Difficulties, or rather Impoſſibilities, as I think no Man can digeſt. For he that affirms the World, as now it ſtands, to have been Eternal, muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity grant that there has been an Eternal Succeſſion of Men, Beaſts, and Vegetables, and that to a number actually infinite: (for if the number be not infinite, how can the Succeſſion have been Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?) And yet a number actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite to me appears to be a plain Contradiction. For that which is infinite cannot be made bigger, whereas there is no number but may be made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40650:10"/> bigger by the Addition of Units. Again if any one ſhall affirm that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number is no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that there has been a Succeſſion of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beings in the World; then thus I argue, That if there has been a Succeſſion of an infinite number of Men, Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, by a Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reaſon, there has been alſo a Succeſſion of an infinite number of Days and Nights; and if ſo, then likewiſe of an infinite number of Years too; (for if the number of Years can be limited, ſo can that of Days too, ſince every Year contains juſt ſuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Days.) Now this I ſuppoſe muſt be granted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:10"/> me, That infinite numbers are equal: (for if one number be leſs than another, how can it be infinite?) And if ſo, then it muſt follow that in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the World the number of Years is equal to the number of Days, which is abſurd; becauſe every Year contains in its ſelf a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 365 Days. Theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or rather Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I ſay, do make the notion of the World's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (I mean as the World now is) to appear to me as an abſurd and unreaſonable Suppoſition. But then as to God, Although I confeſs it to be difficult, and perhaps impoſſible, for Man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the manner, how he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40650:11"/> is, or can be, eternal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning; yet ſince the thing it ſelf is ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollably evident that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo eternal, (though the manner how is to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible) I find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scruple or Difficulty in admitting the Eternity of God. For though it ſeems contrary to all reaſon to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm an eternal Succeſſion of divers things, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without a Beginning; yet I can find no manner of Repugnancy in maintaining that there is one immutable Being <hi>(i. e.</hi> God) which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver began to be.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40650:11"/> Eternity, or whether it were produced out of nothing by the Almighty Power of God, is a Queſtion which reaſon alone, I think, can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and conſider the great Variety, Order, Beauty, and Uſefulneſs, which do evidently appear in all the Parts of the World, as they are placed together, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one another; I cannot but conclude, That <hi>the whole World, and all its Parts, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, framed and faſhioned, by a wiſe and powerful Being, whom we call God:</hi> As when I ſee a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Clock or Engine, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude that it was made and contrived by ſome Artiſt; and ſhould laugh at

                  <p n="8">VIII.

The Hiſtories of all Ages, and Travellers into all Countries, do univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in this Teſtimony, That there is no Nation or People, whether learned or unlearned, but what do own the being of a God. And thoſe few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have preſumed to deny it, have ever been look'd on as Prodigies and Monſters of Mankind. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, even thoſe few who have denied the Being of God, have ever beeen Men of ſuch debauched and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Lives, that we have great Reaſon to believe that they firſt have wiſhed that there might be no God to puniſh them; and then, without any other ground or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40650:13"/> Reaſon, have believed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretended to believe, what they have wiſhed. For it is almoſt ever obſerved, that when debauched and atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons do draw near to Death, they do either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renounce their Atheiſm, own the being of a God, and make Supplication to him; or at leaſt have their Minds poſſeſt with ſuch doubts and fears, as plainly ſhew that they have ſtill a ſtrong Suſpicion that there likely may be a God, for ought they know, who will call them to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Since then all ſorts of Men, both learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and all Nations of Men, both civil and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40650:13"/> have always owned the Being of God; ſince his being has never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but by very few indeed; ſince that denial has rather proceeded from their Wiſhes and Deſires, than from their Reaſon and Underſtanding; and laſtly, ſince they have not been able wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Belief of a God out of their Minds although they have earneſtly endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it; I conclude, That <hi>the Belief of a God, in Man, is neither the Effect of Chance,</hi> becauſe 'tis Univerſal, <hi>nor of Ignorance,</hi> becauſe it poſſeſſes the moſt Learned, <hi>nor of State-Policy,</hi> becauſe 'tis received among the moſt barbarous and unciviliz'd People; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40650:14"/> that <hi>there is a God, who has made all Men, and has (as a Token of his Work) ſtamped and engraved</hi> this <hi>his Mark and Character upon them.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40650:18"/> Belief; That the Profeſſors of this Belief were called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; That they were moſt cruelly perſecuted, and many Thouſands of them put to death, and that with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torments, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they were Chriſtians; That theſe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions were ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againg them, for the ſpace of about Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years; And yet, for all this, that the Number of Chriſtians daily increaſed, and that not only Ideots and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Men, but great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Philoſophers were converted to Chriſtianity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Times of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; All this, being merely Matter of Fact, was never yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40650:19"/> denied by the greateſt Enemies of Chriſtian Religion. And, indeed, theſe things are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teſtified by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and other Writings, of thoſe Times; and have been ſo generally receiv'd for Truth, as well by the Oppoſers, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of Chriſtianity, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, univerſal, and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Tradition, from thoſe Days, even unto this Time; that a Man may as well deny the Truth of any, or of all, the Hiſtories of the World, as of this. Now, ſince all Men generally have a ſtrong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to retain and ſtick to that Religion (whatever it be) in which both they and their Fathers have been brought up; and no leſs an Averſion to all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40650:19"/> cauſeleſs Innovations in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; Moreover, ſince all Men, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, who are in their Wits, have naturally a moſt earneſt deſire to preſerve their Lives as long as they can, and to keep themſelves free from Pain and Trouble; I think I may reaſonably conclude, that <hi>there muſt have been ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrong, and even irreſiſtable Motive, which could prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Multitudes of People to forſake theirs and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors old Religion, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſtianity,</hi> which then had but newly appeared in the World, and which, in thoſe Days, did ſeldom fail to involve its Proſelytes in moſt grievous Troubles and Perſecutions.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40650:20"/>XVII. That this Motive could not be the Hopes of any Profit or Advantage in this Life, is moſt evident: Becauſe Chriſtianity was, in thoſe Days, moſt commonly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, even unto death. It muſt therefore, of neceſſity, be the hopes of ſome Benefit or Happineſs which ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to them, after this Life was at an end. And this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or Happineſs could not ſeem ſmall and inconſiderable to them; nor could the Hope which they conceived of it be weak, or doubtful: For there is ſcarce any Man, or ever was, in the World, who would run himſelf into certain Miſery and Perſecution, even to the loſing of his Life, only upon a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40650:20"/> 
                     <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>doubtful</hi> Hope of ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable</hi> Benefit or Happineſs to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in a Life to come. I conclude therefore, That <hi>the Primitive Chriſtians were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtingly poſſeſſed with a ſtrong Belief, and moſt firm Perſuaſion, That whoſoever ſhould truly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, profeſs, and live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, the Chriſtian Religion in this Life, was certainly to be made Partaker of ſome great and ineſtimable Happineſs in the Life to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. That this Belief and Perſuaſion did not proceed from any Frenzy, or Madneſs, (which ſometimes poſſeſſes Man with very ſtrong Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,) is very evident; both becauſe there was ſuch a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40650:21"/> of them, who exactly agreed in the ſame Sentiments; and alſo, becauſe it appears, both from the Writings and Actions of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they were Men of Reaſon and Sobriety, and ſome of them Perſons of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. As evident alſo it is, that it could not proceed from the Force of any Argument. drawn from the Principles of bare Natural Reaſon, without Revelation. For, What Man in his Wits, without preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome Revelation from Heaven, could ever be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Embracing of the Religion taught by ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon, more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would make him happy in the Life to come? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40650:21"/> therefore, That <hi>the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus, who preached Chriſtianity abroad in the World, did convince and ſatisfie their Proſelytes, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God from Heaven, that whoſoever would believe on Jeſus, and receive, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to, his Religion ſhould be made very happy in the next Life,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. The main Argument which the firſt Preachers of Chriſtianity made uſe of, to convince the World that this was a Divine Revelation, was this; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe that Jeſus, in his Life time, did perform ſuch and ſo many Miracles, and wonderful Works, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhewed, that he had his Commiſſion and Power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40650:22"/> from God; and becauſe his Diſciples (whom he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to teach his Religion to the World) for many Years after his Death, did likewiſe continue to work many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Name of Jeſus; Which ſhewed, that God was with them in what they did and taught. The things by them alledged to have been performed by Jeſus, were ſuch as theſe: That he healed all manner of Diſeaſes and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers with a Touch, or barely with a Word ſpeaking; That he gave Sight to the Blind, Hearing to the Deaf, Speech to the Dumb, and Strengh and Agility to the Lame and Maimed; That he raiſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons from the Dead;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40650:22"/> and that he himſelf aroſe from the Dead, after he had been Crucified, and a Spear thruſt into his Vitals, and had lay'n dead in a Sepulchre unto the Third Day; And laſtly, That, after his Reſurrection, having ſeveral times appeared to his Diſciples, and converſed with them, for the ſpace of Forty Days, he was, at laſt, openly, and in their ſight, taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into Heaven. The things alledged to have been done by his Diſciples, were, The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sick, the Lame, the Maimed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, their Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Languages, although they never had learned them. That all theſe things were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the firſt Preachers of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40650:23"/> Chriſtianity, is confeſſed on all Hands. And, undoubtedly, they muſt needs, at leaſt, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> ſomething that was very extraordinary, or elſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have converted ſuch vaſt Multitudes, under ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſadvantages as they and their Religion laboured. That theſe things were not only pretended, but really and actually performed, is, to my Opinion, uncontrollably evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Teſtimony of the Diſciples themſelves, Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared theſe things for Truth unto the World; Who could not themſelves be deceived in thoſe Matters of Fact, of which they pretended to have been Eye-Witneſſes; Who never would go about to impoſe a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40650:23"/> Lye upon the World, by which they could propoſe to themſelves no manner of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this Life, nor (if it were a Lye) in the Life to come; Who never would have expoſed themſelves to Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Racks, to Gibbets, to Fire and Faggot, (in a Word) to all ſorts of Torments and Deaths, only for the ſake of a fruitleſs and unprofitable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Who being Men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Lives, for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, had, doubtleſs, more Honeſty and Integrity, than to affirm thoſe things for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truths, which they muſt needs know to be meer Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Who were too many in Number, and too void of Craft and Guile, to combine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40650:24"/> together in framing a falſe Story, and none of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to betray or diſcover the Cheat; Who could never hope to impoſe the Belief of ſuch a Story upon a curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Age (ſuch as that was wherein they lived) if it had been falſe, and therefore would certainly never have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if they had not known it to have been true; And, Laſtly, who, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ſuch Multitudes as they did, muſt needs have been palpably diſcovered, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the World for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of lewd Cheats and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, in pretending that ſuch and ſuch things were done in the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (and done openly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40650:24"/> too, in the Face of the World,) when it was ſo eaſie a matter to go or ſend to the place, to make Enquiry, and ſo to find out the Cheat, if a Cheat it had been. But that theſe ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and wonderful Works, did far ſurpaſs both the Courſe of Nature, and the Power of Art, is very evident; That they were not perform'd by the Aſſiſtance of any wicked Spirit, does ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; becauſe the very Intent and Deſign of them was to propagate a Doctrine in the World, which, by all, muſt be allowed to teach the pureſt, and moſt ſtrict Morality; to which it cannot be imagined, that any Impure and Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would contribute any help.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40650:25"/> It remains therefore, that theſe things muſt needs have been performed, either by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power and Aſſiſtance of God, (who is both the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Controller of Nature) or (which is the ſame thing in effect) by the Mediation and Miniſtry of good Spirits, who always act obediently to his Will. So that (whether me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or immediately) it is God who is to be looked upon as the Original and Author of all thoſe wonderful Things, which were done by Jeſus, and his Diſciples. Now then; Since God did interpoſe his Power, to work ſuch ſtrange and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penduous things, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and Confirmation of that Doctrine which was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40650:25"/> taught by Jeſus and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; This I think, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demonſtration, that their Doctrine was certainly true. For, Who can imagine that God ſhould make uſe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Power, only to cheat and deceive the World into the Belief of a Lye? I conclude therefore, That <hi>the Primitive Chriſtians had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon to believe, that it was revealed by God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that whoſoever would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Jeſus, and receive, and live according to his Religion, ſhould be made very happy in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next Life;</hi> this very thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grand Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which Jeſus and his Diſciples taught and preached to the World. And if we are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40650:26"/> ſure that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had Reaſon ſufficient to believe this; from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That <hi>we have ſufficient Reaſon to believe it alſo.</hi>

But Jeſus himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long ſince aſcended into Heaven, and his Diſciples, who firſt preached the Goſpel, departed out of the World; here, <hi>I think, it is neceſſary to enquire, to whom, or to what I muſt apply my ſelf, that</hi> (amidſt the ſeveral Parties in the World, who all call themſelves True and Orthodox Chriſtians, each condemning all others but themſelves) <hi>I may be truly and ſurely informed what is the true and genuine Religion or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus, which I ought to receive, and live according
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40650:26"/> to, in order to my future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> For, if I do not this, I muſt either reject the Doctrine of Jeſus, and ſo loſe my future Happineſs; or elſe take it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon Truſt, and by chance, and then 'tis odds but I light upon the wrong, and muſt needs run a very great hazard. And though he who is in a Miſtake, and cannot tell how to help it, will, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, find an eaſie Pardon from God; yet he who falls into Errour, for want of moderate Care and Diligence to find out the Truth, has, I think, no pretence either to Pardon, or ſo much as to Pity.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. The <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> do tell me, that I muſt apply my ſelf to the Church.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40650:27"/> This Church they define to be, that Society of Perſons who proſeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and live in Subjection to, and Communion with the Pope, or Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Church they ſay is infallible; and not only does not, but cannot err in any Doctrine of Religion, Go then, ſay they, to this Church, and receive the Doctrine which ſhe teaches; and there you have, certainly and infallibly, the true and pure Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. But I cannot give my Aſſent to follow this their Direction, becauſe I find ſuch great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in my way as, I think, are inſuparable; at leaſt, I am ſure, ſuch as I am not able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Although
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40650:27"/> it may be a certain Truth, that there ſhall always be a Church, that is to ſay, a Company of People, ſome where or other, profeſſing the true Chriſtian Religion, as long as the World ſhall laſt; yet what ſolid Proof can be brought, that this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Society of Men, who live in Communion with the Pope, or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> are alone the true Church, and ſhall always keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain amongſt them the true and uncorrupt Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? This Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Queſtion of Revelation, and poſitive Inſtitution, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being proved by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Argument drawn from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon. And, as for the Texts of Scripture which they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40650:28"/> alledge, it is even ridiculous to think, that any ſober and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Perſon ſhould be convinced by them; (as will evidently appear to any one, who impartially reads what the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Proteſtant Divines have written on this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie:) For there are none of thoſe Texts, but are fairly and naturally capable of another Interpretation; and muſt be very much ſtrained and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make them countenance the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine. Beſides that, the Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do generally teach, That no Man can be ſure of the Authority or Senſe of any Text of Scripture, (eſpecially if it appear to be any way doubtful,) except he receives
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40650:28"/> the Propoſal and Interpretation thereof from this their Church, which they ſay is infallible. So that a Man muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty believe the Infallibility of their Church, before he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way be ſure of the Credit, or even of the Senſe, of thoſe Texts of Scripture which they bring to prove it. And then, What need is there of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Arguments to prove a thing, which muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, before the Arguments can have any force, or even be as much as certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? And if they tell me, that the Fathers, and ancient Chriſtian Writers, do teſtifie thus much of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I can only ſay, that the Proteſtant Divines (who
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40650:29"/> ſeem to me to be Men of as much Learning and Integrity as the <hi>Romiſh)</hi> do declare, that it is far otherwiſe. Nor have I Skill enough in Language and Antiquity, to take upon me to judge of this Diſpute. Neither do I underſtand, by what Authority the Writings of thoſe Perſons, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Errours, ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on me as a Rule of my Faith, or as a ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to determine my Aſſent in ſo weighty a Matter. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Suppoſing, but not granting, that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the true and pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; yet ſtill it is granted, that particular and private
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40650:29"/> Men, who live in the viſible Communion of that Church, may teach falſe and corrupt Doctrine. Here then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How ſhall I certainly diſtinguiſh the Doctrine of the Church, from the Opinions of private Men? And how ſhall I certainly know what is the true Meaning of the Church's Doctrine? They of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are not agreed who it is, that has Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and expound the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Church; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the Pope, or a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; or neither alone, but both together. Or if they were unanimous in this Point, yet how ſhall I know whether ſuch a particular Perſon, who poſſeſſes the Chair, be a true
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40650:30"/> and lawful Pope; or ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Aſſembly, a true and lawful General Council? Or, Suppoſe they could ſatisfie me in this Demand, yet there is no Council now ſitting, nor, if there were, could I go to them, or to the Pope, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Inſtruction; nor can the Pope, or a Council, be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſatisfie the Demands of every private Enquirer. How then can I be ſure that this or that particular Perſon does both rightly underſtand, and faithfully propoſe the Doctrine of the Church to me? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince there have been, and ſtill are, eminent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have accuſed each other of corrupt Doctrine, and even
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40650:30"/> of Hereſie it ſelf. But, <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Laſtly,</hi> There do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be much ſtronger Arguments to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has actually erred, and corrupted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, (in the Caſe of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſome other her Tenents,) than any that can be brought, to prove her to be infallible. And until I can be otherwiſe convinced, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That <hi>to follow the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, is not the way to embrace the true and pure Doctrine of Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. Some there are who tell me, that, to find out the true and genuine Doctrine of Jeſus, I muſt have recourſe to the Tradition of the Church:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40650:31"/> And thus they ſet forth the Matter. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſuppoſe that the true and genuine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught by his Apoſtles, and firſt Diſciples. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if any one did, or ſhould have gone about to ſpread any falſe or ſpurious Doctrine, whilſt theſe Apoſtles and Diſciples were yet alive; They who were ſent on purpoſe, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to preach his Doctrine, and were owned, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accordingly by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, both could and would immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all Churches of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſpuriouſneſs of ſuch pretended Doctrine. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That the Doctrine of Jeſus being in all Churches publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40650:31"/> and conſtantly taught and preached, every ſucceeding Age and Generation muſt needs know, and could not poſſibly be ignorant, what their Fathers, and immediate Predeceſſors owned and taught as ſuch. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if, at any time whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, any new or ſpurious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was, or ſhould be, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any Perſon or Perſons, as the Doctrine of Jeſus, all Chriſtians muſt preſently know that this was none of his Doctrine, becauſe it was not taught them as ſuch, by their immediate Predeceſſors. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That therefore it is impoſſible that any new and ſpurious Doctrine could ever be broached in the World, as a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40650:32"/> part of the Doctrine of Jeſus, but it muſt needs meet with great Oppoſition: For all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do maintain, That it is a Sin to teach, or knowingly to own, any thing as the Doctrine of Jeſus, which is not really ſo. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That however ſome Men, out of Pride or Intereſt, may own and contend for any ſuch novel Doctrines, yet it is impoſſible that any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould ever come to be univerſally received by the whole Church, except we could ſuppoſe, either that the whole Church ſhould joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to involve themſelves and their Poſterity for ever in a Sin; or elſe, that a few Men, who firſt ſhould vent an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, could ſo impoſe upon the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40650:32"/> whole World, as to make them believe, that what they all muſt know to be a new and upſtart thing (becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Predeceſſors) was a part of the ancient Doctrine of Jeſus, which was all along, from Hand to Hand, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down to them: Both which things are abſurd to conceive or imagine. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That no part of the Doctrine of Jeſus, once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, could ever be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or wholly forgot in the World; becauſe every Age of Chriſtians, from the very firſt, who undoubtedly received the whole and entire Doctrine of Jeſus, knew themſelves to be indiſpenſably obliged, both by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40650:33"/> God's Command, and alſo by that Love and Charity which they owed to their Poſterity to teach the ſame full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Doctrine which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, unto their Children and thoſe who were to come after them. Go therefore to the Church (that is, to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; to the Univerſal Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to all Chriſtians, ſay ſome Proteſtants,) and ſee what are the Doctrines which are, and have been univerſally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; of whoſe Beginning no other Account can be given, but that Jeſus and his Apoſtles taught them to the World: And there you have the entire and uncorrupted Doctrine of Jeſus. But to this I anſwer,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40650:33"/> That, indeed, where there is an univerſal, or a very large and general Tradition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any thing; and where; from the nature of the thing it ſelf, it appears to be highly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and probable, that there is not, or could not be, any Errour or Miſtake in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in ſuch a Caſe as this, no Man, I think, but an obſtinate Sceptick, will offer to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Evidence of ſuch a Tradition. But, let a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ever ſo general, or even univerſal; yet, if it can be ſhewn, that there is not only a poſſibility, but alſo a fair like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and probability, that there may be a miſtake in the buſineſs; then, I think, no Man can juſtly be blamed, if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40650:34"/> he refuſes or ſuſpends his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, until the Teſtimony of ſuch a Tradition be cleared and vindicated from thoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Prejudices and Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may lie againſt it. Now, if it were ſo, that all Errours and Miſtakes did ever immediately appear in their perfect Form, and full Growth, at their very Beginning; then it were moſt rational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all Men muſt needs take notice of their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and conſequently, that, in all likelihood, any ſuch Error muſt needs meet with many more Opponents, than Abettors. But, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it may well be ſuppoſed, that Errours may have ſprung up in the World, from ſuch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40650:34"/> ſmall beginnings, and by ſuch ſlow and unperceivable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that, after ſome Ages, it may be impoſſible for a Man to diſcover them to be Errours, except he has ſome other Rule, beſides Tradition, to try them by; <hi>viz.</hi> either the Rule of common Reaſon, or ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and unaltered Writing. As for Example; It is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to conceive, that, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, they who preached and writ popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſcourſes, might, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, and to good purpoſe, make uſe of Rhetorical Flights, and Figurative Expreſſions, to ſtrike the Fancies, and move the Affections of the People to Vertue and Piety? And is it not likely enough, That thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40650:35"/> who came after them, might not only ſtrive to imitate, but alſo to out-do them, in bolder Flights, and more ſtrained Schemes of Expreſſion? And is it not alſo probable enough, That, in long proceſs of Time, Ignorance, generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading the Face of the World, and being joyned with a profound Veneration for thoſe ancient Preachers and Writers, might begin to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret ſome of theſe Rhetorical and Figurative Expreſſions in a Literal and Logical Sence; and then conceive, that ſuch their Interpretations were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines delivered down to them? Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there may have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40650:35"/> ſome Men of great Power and Repute in the World, who might have taken a pride and delight, or whoſe Intereſt it might have been, to amuze the People with myſterious Notions and Fancies, and to keep them ignorant of the Truth. And thus it appears to be, not only poſſible, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo probable enough, That Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Miſtakes, as to the ancient Doctrine of Jeſus, might come to be generally received, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or notorious Oppoſition given to them; or that ſuch Oppoſition might ſoon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and over-ruled by the Power and Reputation of ſuch prevailing Men. From all which I cannot but conclude,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40650:36"/> That <hi>though the general Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Teſtimony of the Church may be a good Help, yet it may not always be a certain Rule, to lead me to the entire, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Doctrine of Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. Other there are, who tell me, That, to find out the true and entire Doctrine of Jeſus, I muſt apply my ſelf to the holy Scripture; that is to ſay, to the Books commonly called the <hi>Old,</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And becauſe I look upon this to be the right Way, I ſhall briefly and plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my Thoughts, in relation to theſe Books. And firſt, of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> That the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Greek Toegue, has been ever univerſally owned
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40650:36"/> by all Chriſtians, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true (though ſome deny it to be a full) Account of the Life and Doctrine of Jeſus, is a thing ſo notorious, and ſo univerſally acknowledged, that I cannot find the leaſt Ground or Reaſon to queſtion it. Now the Hiſtory and Doctrine of Jeſus being ſo well known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt Chriſtians, by the Preaching of the Apoſtles and Diſciples; and they being ſo ready, upon all Occaſions, to lay down their Lives for the Truth of Chriſtianity; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined that ever they would ſo readily and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally receive and own ſuch a Book, if it had contained any thing in it which was diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from that Doctrine which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40650:37"/> they had received. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, indeed, that ſome of thoſe Books which make up the Volume of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (that is to ſay, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that of St. <hi>James,</hi> the Second of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,)</hi> were not ſo ſoon, and ſo univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, as the reſt of the Books were. The Reaſon of which, apparently, was not, That theſe Books contained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in them contrary to what was delivered it the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (for he that reads the whole, will plainly find, that there is a very compleat Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40650:37"/> between them; the only ſeeming Diſcord, of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juſtification by Faith, and St. <hi>James</hi>'s Juſtification by Works, being exactly and fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, by conſidering, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> means no other Faith, but ſuch as worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and St. <hi>James,</hi> no other Works, but ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 22.) But becauſe it was not at firſt univerſally known, who were the Authors of them. Which abundantly ſhews the Care and Caution of the Chriſtian Church, in not being haſty to receive and admit any Books, as authentick Records of their Doctrine, without very good Warrant for ſo doing. And therefore, ſince theſe ſame
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40650:38"/> Books were, in a very little time after, received, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of equal Authority with the reſt of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I cannot but from thence conclude, That thoſe Churches which, at the firſt, doubted concerning thoſe Books, did ſoon receive moſt full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Satisfaction in that matter, from thoſe who had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That <hi>the Book of the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>as it was extant in the Primitive Times, in the Greek Tongue, did contain a true Account of the Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. That innumerable Copies of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were, in a very little time, diſperſed through all places
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40650:38"/> where Chriſtianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; That it has heen, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, and in very diſtant places, tranſlated into all (or almoſt all) Languages; And that Copies, both of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and many of the ſeveral Tranſlations, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with much Care, in a great many diſtant Parts of the World, is allowed by all, and denied by none. From whence I think we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>where the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Greek Copies of the</hi> New Teſtament <hi>do agree in the very ſame Words, there we have, undoubtedly, the true and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Words of the</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, although ſome Miſtakes might creep into ſome Copies, either through
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40650:39"/> the Wickedneſs or Negligence of ſome particular Men; yet, where ſo many Copies of a Book have been ſo carefully preſerved, and in ſuch diſtant Parts of the World, it is not to be imagined, that the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Errour, in any Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould ever be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Generality of them. Secondly, That <hi>where the Words or Expreſſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Greek Copies do differ one from another; yet if the Senſe and Meaning be exactly the ſame in all, or almoſt all; there we have certainly the true Senſe and Meaning of the</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For it is eaſie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that a Tranſcriber might, by a ſmall Miſtake, put one Word or Expreſſion of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40650:39"/> ſame Signification, in ſtead of another: But that the ſame Senſe ſhould be punctually preſerved in all, or almoſt all, Copies is not to be imagined, except it were the true Senſe delivered from the Beginning. Thirdly, That <hi>if there may be found any different Readings in divers Copies of the</hi> New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>which diſagree in Senſe, as well as in Words,</hi> (which ſcarce ever happens in any thing which is accounted a material Point of Religion) <hi>then it ſeems to be moſt fit and proper to admit of that Reading and Senſe which beſt agrees with the Tenour of the whole; with the ancientest, and best eſteemed Tranſlations; and with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles of ſound Reaſon.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40650:40"/> And if any place be ſo obſcure, as that none of theſe Ways will afford any Light into its Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then I think that no ſtreſs ought to be laid upon it in any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. But ſome will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How are we ſure of the Senſe and Meaning, even of thoſe places of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Words? In Anſwar to this, I have already ſhewn, (§. 21.) that we are not to follow the Guidance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know the true Doctrine of Jeſus; Nor therefore, conſequently, to know the true Meaning of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in which his Doctrine is owned to be contained. I have ſhewn alſo,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40650:40"/> (§. 22.) That though general Tradition may be a good Help, yet may it not always be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule to lead one to the unaltered Doctrine of Jeſus; nor therefore, conſequently, to the true and genuine Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Since therefore there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to be found, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That <hi>the</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>is to be interpreted the ſame way that other Books are;</hi> that is, by conſidering the Senſe and Property of the Words and Sentences, and the ordinary Figures of Speech, as they are commonly uſed in the ſame Book, and in others written in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and about the ſame, time; together with the Scope,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40650:41"/> Drift, Coherence, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Diſcourſe. <hi>To which End, every Man that is learned,</hi> being bound to uſe his beſt Endeavour to know the Will of God, (as I have ſhewn, §. 14.) <hi>is obliged, according to the meaſure of his Learning, to conſult Lexicons, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ancient Writers, and to uſe all other Helps;</hi> that he may both ſatisfie himſelf, and alſo be able to inform others.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. But perhaps I ſhall be told, That when a Man has done all this, to the beſt of his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, after all, he may be miſtaken; as it appears, that many Learned Men are; ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> oppoſe and contradict one another about the Meaning of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> To this Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40650:41"/> That ſince I have ſhewn, (§. 3.) that all neceſſary things (whether as to Belief, or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) in Religion, are eaſie to be underſtood; I muſt from hence conclude, That <hi>a ſober and honest Enquirer cannot eaſily be miſtaken in the Interpretation of thoſe places of the</hi> New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>which do contain any neceſſary part of Religion.</hi> And as for other parts and paſſages of it; if Men would be but peaceable, (which is plainly enough commanded in the <hi>New Teſtament,)</hi> their Miſtakes about them could do no harm. And, again; Since I have ſhewn, (§. 14.) That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more from a Man, but his beſt Endeavours to know and perform his Will;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40650:42"/> I do hence conclude, That <hi>if a Man be miſtaken in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation even of any ſuch place as contains ſome neceſſary part of Religion; yet, if this Miſtake be purely an Errour of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any Neglect, or wilful Fault of the Perſon ſo miſtaking; God will never be offended with him for it.</hi> And then, What hurt can there be in ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake as this?</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. But it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, What ſhall they do to find out the Meaning of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> who do not underſtand any thing of the Greek, which is the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Language of this Book? Which is evidently the Caſe of much the greateſt part
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40650:42"/> of Mankind. I anſwer, That <hi>he who is ignorant of the Greek Tongue,</hi> being yet obliged to uſe his beſt Endeavour, (§. 14.) <hi>muſt do the beſt he can, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Tranſlation, or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of it; (or, if he cannot read himſelf, by hearing them read;) and by asking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring from ſuch of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance as he believes to be Perſons of Sincerity and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to know what is the Senſe and Doctrine of the</hi> New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>and the Will of God therein contained.</hi> And, ſince God requires no more from any Man, but his beſt Endeavour, (§. 14.) it follows, That <hi>if ſuch a Man be miſtaken, and cannot help it, God will not be offended with him neither for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:40650:43"/>XXVIII. And one thing more let me add, for the ſake of thoſe who are not skilled in the Greek Tongue; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince there have many Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations been made of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> moſt of them by Perſons well skilled in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, of good Repute for their Honeſty and Integrity, and who could not but know before-hand, that their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations would be narrowly ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and examined by learned Men; (which muſt needs make them careful to commit as few Faults as they could;) and ſince all thoſe things which God requires from Men, muſt needs be eaſie enough to be underſtood, (§. 3.) and therefore eaſie to be tranſlated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40650:43"/> in any Language; I cannot but conclude, That <hi>a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and impartial Enquirer may be very well aſſured of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus, even from the Tranſlations of the</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>though he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Greek Original.</hi> And, for as much as I can underſtand of the matter, if Men did ſtand only upon the honeſt and downright Senſe and Meaning of plain Places, (which only can ſtive us good Aſſurance in Religion,) and would not quarrel about critical Niceties in ſuch Texts as are confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcure, I believe there is ſcarce any Tranſlation of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo defective, but might be a ſufficient Guide to any ſober Man, to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40650:44"/> lead him to the Doctrine of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. Having thus ſpoken what I deſigned of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I come to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Old.</hi> And here, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Days of Jeſus, had among them a Book, written in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſome ſmall part of it in the <hi>Chaldee-</hi>Tongue, which we now call the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which they called the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and eſteemed as the Word of God, is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute. That this Book was owned and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, quoted and referred to, and all People exhorted and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſearch and ſtudy it, as the Word of God, both by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelf, and alſo by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40650:44"/> is moſt evident to any one who reads the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> From whence I muſt conclude, That <hi>the Doctrine of that Book, as it was then extant, is to be eſteemed as part of the Doctrine of Jeſus; and that thoſe Laws and Commands which are there to be found, are to be kept and obſerved by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the Followers of Jeſus; except where it can be ſhewn that Jeſus has freed us from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">XXX. Moreover, ſince this Book has been Tranſlated into as many Languages, and as many Copies of the Original have been carefully kept, in diſtant Parts of the World, as of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> I do conclude, That <hi>the very ſame
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40650:45"/> things which just now were ſaid concerning the Words, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Way of interpreting the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>will hold good concerning the</hi> Old Teſtament <hi>alſo, as far as they can be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">XXXI. There are ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Books and Fragments, which among the Proteſtants are well known by the Name of <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> to which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts give the Title of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical.</hi> Theſe Pieces the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts contend to be a real part of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and of equal Authority with the other Books of it: But the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants will not allow their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be ſacred, although they grant that there are many uſeful and profitable things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40650:45"/> contained in them. Now, he that is not able to ſearch into Antiquity, for the Reſolving of this Controverſie, may by another way be ſatisfied about it. For, ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> (from whom the Chriſtians original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament)</hi> do all of them, and ever did, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reject theſe ſame <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> Books and Fragments, as being no part of their Holy Scripture; I think it may from hence be ſufficiently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That, <hi>as to the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about the Apocryphal Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the Proteſtants are in the right, and the Papiſts in the wrong.</hi> And yet, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe Pieces were as great as the Papiſts would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40650:46"/> have it, I ſee not how it could make any Alteration in my Religion. For I do not find any thing in them, but what is eaſily reconcilable with the reſt of the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="32">XXXII. But there are ſome Difficulties which ſeem to ariſe concerning what I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, to which it will be neceſſary to give a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer. And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If all be granted that has hitherto been ſaid; yet, how ſhall I be ſure that the Book of the holy Scriptures contains, not only truly, but alſo fully and entirely, the Doctrine of Jeſus; ſo that nothing is to be eſteemed as a part of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what is contained in the Scripture? To this I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40650:46"/> might anſwer, That there are ſeveral Paſſages in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf, which do give us to underſtand, that the whole Law and Will of God, as far as it is needful for Man to know them, are contained in thoſe holy Writings; (as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines do ſufficiently make appear, in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts.) But, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, I think it is enough to ſay, That <hi>it is not, indeed, impoſſible in it ſelf, but that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus might have made known other Particulars of Doctrine, and of the Will of God, beſides what is conſigned to us by the Scripture. And if any Man can effectually prove, that any ſuch Doctrine or Precept was delivered by him;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40650:47"/> I think, that whoſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Proof, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Doctrine, and obey that Precept, which appear to be ſo delivered. But he that does his hearty and ſincere Endeavour to find out the Doctrine and Will of God, delivered to Man by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and is not able, with all his Diligence, to diſcover any more of it, than what is recorded in the Scripture; if he faithfully keeps and obſerves as much of it as he is able there to diſcover, it is plain that God requires no more from him,</hi> (§. 14.) and therefore certainly will not puniſh him, for want of any thing farther.</p>
                  <p n="33">XXXIII. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be objected, That in Reading theſe Books, there do appear to be ſome Paſſages which are in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40650:47"/> themſelves abſurd, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the plain Dictates of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſome which are irreconcileable with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, that the Doctrine of Jeſus is certainly true, muſt be allowed, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God. That both parts of a Contradiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, is acknowledged by all Men: And no Man, I think, can own that for a Truth, which is contrary to the plain Dictates of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding; which to every Man is, and muſt be, the Standard of all Truth whatſoever. For there can be no Reaſon why any Man receives and owns any thing for a Truth, but only becauſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40650:48"/> he apprehends it to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto the plain and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Notions which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready planted in his Mind. Here then it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how it canbe poſſible that theſe Scriptures ſhould contain the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of Jeſus? To this I anſwer: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>I cannot find any appearance of a Contradiction, throughout the Holy Scriptures, in any Point of Doctrine, or Rule of Manners, but what is ſo eaſie and obvious to be reconciled,</hi> that no Man, I think, of Candour and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, but would be aſhamed to object it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And, <hi>as for thoſe few ſeeming Diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances, which do occurr in the Circumſtances of ſome Hiſtorical
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40650:48"/> Narrations; though I, perhaps, am not able to reconcile them, yet it may be that the things themſelves may not be abſolutely irreconcilable. But ſuppoſe they were, yet it is no derogation to the Truth of the Hiſtory, (as to the main ſubſtance of it, ) or of the Doctrine contained in the holy Scriptures, that ſome of the Sacred Writers have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Relation of ſome ſmall and inconſiderable Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> There are ſeveral Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Chroniclers, which give an Account of the Life and Reign of many of our Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ in many Circumſtances of things, yet this was never made an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doubt of the Truth of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40650:49"/> the main Hiſtory, wherein they all agree. And why may not the Scripture-Hiſtorians be as favourably cenſured as all other Hiſtorians in the World are? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which are above my Reaſon and Underſtanding which I cannot comprehend in my Mind, nor frame a clear and diſtinct Notion of; which yet I cannot ſay, are contrary to my Reaſon: Becauſe (though they are above my reach, yet) I do not find that they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict any of thoſe plain and ſelf-evident Principles which are implanted in my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For Example, I am not able diſtinctly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the ſmalleſt Particle of Matter, which can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40650:49"/> is yet in it ſelf capable of being for ever divided; ſo that no part of Matter, though ever ſo ſmall, can ever be ſo much as convinced to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inviſible. And yet this is ſo far from being contrary to my Reaſon, that my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf does fully ſatisfie me that the thing is ſo, though I am not able to comprehend the manner of it. The ſame thing alſo may be ſaid concerning the neceſſity of ſome thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without any Beginning. (of which, ſee §. 5, 6.) Now <hi>if I meet with any thing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which is thus above my Reaſon, but not contrary to it, I cannot refuſe my Aſſent unto it.</hi> (I mean always, upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the Words do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40650:50"/> evidently to carry ſuch a Senſe.) For I cannot conclude ſuch a thing to be impoſſible: Becauſe I do not find it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my Reaſon, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. And if it be a thing in my Apprehenſion poſſible, I muſt believe it to be true, when I find that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it ſo to be. Other things, again, there are, which are directly contrary unto thoſe ſelf-evident Notions and Principles, which my Reaſon finds to be connatural with it ſelf. For Example; That <hi>a Part is equal to the Whole;</hi> and ſuch like Abſurdities. Now, <hi>if any</hi> ſuch <hi>Propoſitions</hi> as theſe, <hi>which are contrary to my Reaſon, ſhould occurr to me in Scripture, I cannot poſſibly believe them to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40650:50"/> be true in a Literal Senſe;</hi> (for that were to renounce the clear Dictates of my Reaſon and Underſtanding, upon which the Certainty of all things which I believe or know, is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately built; and without which, I could have no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Being of God, or the Truth of any Religion;) <hi>and therefore I muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them to be meant figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi> And that Figure which beſt agrees to ſuch Words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt common Cuſtom of Speech, and is moſt conformable to common Senſe and Reaſon, I think, is always to be preferred. I never read any Book, to my knowledge, but in it I found many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which, taken literally
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40650:51"/> and ſtrictly, were abſurd and ridiculous; but, taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as 'tis evident they were intended, did contain very good Senſe and Meaning. Since then the Holy Scriptures were written in ſuch Words and Expreſſions as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed among Men in Speaking and Writing, why ſhould we think that ſtrange in them, which is ſo uſual in all other Books?</p>
                  <p n="34">XXXIV. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be objected, That this Doctrine which I have taught, leaves every Man entirely to his own Reaſon and Underſtanding, to find out the true Religion, and the Way to Heaven. Now, ſince there is ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Notions and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40650:51"/> Sentiments of different Men, it muſt needs follow, that, all Men being left wholly to themſelves, there muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be great Variety, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Contrariety, of Opinions among them concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if God requires no more from every Man, but to do his beſt Endeavour, and to chuſe that way which he thinks to be the trueſt; from hence it will follow, That two Men who are contrary one to another in the Point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may yet both be in the right Way to Heaven; and a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a Heathen, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as well as a Chriſtian, if they are but ſtrongly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are in the right. I anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40650:52"/> Objection means, that I leave every Man to his own Reaſon and Underſtanding, without any other help, to find out the Trut of Religion, it is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. For I have aſſerted, That every Man, according to the Meaſure of his Learning, ought to make uſe of all the Means and Helps he can, to underſtand the Scriptures, and the Will of God. (See §. 14. and §. 25.) But if the Meaning be, That <hi>I leave every Man to chuſe that Religion which, after a ſerious Enquiry, appears to him to be the beſt;</hi> (which is all that I contend for;) In this I ſay no more than what all Men muſt, and do, ſay, as well as I. For, either a Man muſt never enquire into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40650:52"/> Truth of his Religion at all, (and then he chuſes his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by mere chance; and ſince there are many falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and but one true, 'tis great odds but he lights upon a wrong one;) Or, if he does enquire. either he muſt chuſe that which he thinks not to be the beſt, (and then he acts againſt his Conſcience,) or that which he thinks is the beſt; Which is what I aſſert, and what every Man of Senſe profeſſes himſelf to do. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> As there are many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Notions and Sentiments of Men, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things which are, in ſome meaſure, abſtruſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; ſo, on the other ſide, there are many things ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40650:53"/> and evident, that Men who are ſincere and unbyaſſed, if they have but common Senſe, can never differ about them: Amongſt which, I think, I may reckon all thoſe things which God requires of neceſſity to any Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton (§. 3.) And whereas the World has, for theſe many Years, found, that compelling Men to this or that Religion, contrary to their own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has been ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Unity of any ſort, that, on the contrary, it has even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Mankind, not only with Variety of Opinions, (each Party taking a delight to thwart other,) but alſo with War and Confuſion; If every Man were left to himſelf, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40650:53"/> follow what Religion he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (as he ſhall anſwer to God for his Sincerity,) it is very probable that moſt Men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Worldly Intereſt to ſerve by this or that Religion, would in time, be brought to agree in all the great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths of Religion; which are plain and evident to every ſober and inquiſitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And as for things not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and of an inferiour ſort, (as I have ſaid, §. 26.) if Men would be but peaceable, their Miſtakes, and conſequently their Differences about them, could do no great harm. But if Men will ſtill differ even about the eſſential and neceſſary Parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I know no Remedy for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40650:54"/> it upon Earth; but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Matter wholly to the Judgment of God in Heaven. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> I do not maintain, That he who is in an Errour, that is, a <hi>Turk,</hi> or an Heathen, (whatſoever the ſtrength and ſincerity of his Perſuaſion may be,) is in as ſure a Way to Heaven and Salvation, as he who is an Orthodox-Man, and a Chriſtian. How God will deal with thoſe that are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cannot help it, I do not determine. All that I would inſinuate (§. 14.) is, That he will not puniſh any Man for any Errour, or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, which he falls into, through a pure Deſect of his Underſtanding, and not through any Fault or Neglect
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40650:54"/> of his Will. But how far he will reward ſuch a Perſon for his good Meaning, is more than I can tell.</p>
                  <p n="35">XXXV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be objected, That this Doctrine does, in effect, undermine and enervate the Force and Power of all Civil Government, by opening a Way for all Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to eſcape Puniſhment, how great ſoever their Crimes may be. If ſuch a Perſon ſhould plead thus for himſelf, That he was fully perſuaded in his Mind and Conſcience, that it was the Will of God, that he ſhould commit ſuch a Theſt, or Murther, of which he is accuſed; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it was his Duty, in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40650:55"/> ſight of God, to act according to this Perſuaſion; The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who knows not the Hearts of Men, can never be able certainly to diſcover, but that this is a real Truth, that he was ſo perſuaded. And if every Man, in all the Duties of Religion, is bound to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Senſe and Perſuaſion of Things; with what Conſcience can a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate puniſh ſuch a Perſon for that Fact, which, for ought he knows, it was his Duty to commit? I will not ſay, but that it may ſo fall out, that a Man may think it to be his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to commit the moſt horrid Villanies, ſince Jeſus Chriſt himſelf aſſures his Diſciples, That the Time would come,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40650:55"/> that whoſo killed them, would think he did God Service, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. And how far God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will be merciful unto ſuch Perſons who commit ſuch Facts out of pure Ignorance, and not out of Malice, I had rather St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine than I. (See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.) But to the Objection, I think it ſufficient to anſwer, That the Civil Magiſtrate, as well as other Men is bound to act according to the cleareſt Conviction, and ſtrongeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of his own Mind. If therefore, upon the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Circumſtances, he be well ſatisfied, and really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that ſuch a Plea from a Malefactor is no real Truth; but only a meſe Trick, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40650:56"/> in hopes to eſcape Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; he ought to take no notice of it, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Sentence according to the Law. But that which comes up cloſe to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and which, I think, is the fulleſt and trueſt Anſwer, is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Civil Magiſtrate has nothing to do to enquire or regard how the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtands between God and the Conſcience of the Tranſgreſſor of the Law of the Land; ſo as to be thereby any way influenced in the Paſſing his Judgment.</hi> It is enough to him, if he be well and throughly convinced, that the Laws by which he acts are no way contrary to the known Law of God. There are many Caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40650:56"/> a Man offends highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God, in which the Civil Magiſtrate has no Power to inflict any Puniſhment on the Offender; becauſe the Fault which he may have committed, does not, it may be, any way tend to the damage or diſturbance of the Civil Society; Which, and which only, is committed to the Care of the Magiſtrate. Such, for Example, are many Acts of Covetouſneſs, or of Prodigality, and other Sins; againſt which it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to provide by any Humane Laws. And, on the other ſide, There are ſome Caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man may ſtand abſolved before the Tribunal of God, and yet be very juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40650:57"/> by the Magiſtrate. Thus, for inſtance, If a Man has committed Theft or Murther, and, upon a ſincere and hearty Repentance, has obtained the Pardon of his Sins from God; yet, nevertheleſs, if ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be accuſed, and legally convicted, of ſuch Crimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil Magiſtrate; He not only may, but ought to put the Law of the Land in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution agninſt him, though he believes him to be ever ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; That it may be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto others. For, if this ought not to be done, every Malefactor, by a pretence of Repentance, (which cannot certainly be diſcovered by any but God,) might eſcape the Laſh of the Law: By which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40650:57"/> Means all wicked Men would be encouraged to commit all ſorts of Crimes. Thus alſo when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded by God to conquer the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we read how they ſent Spies to make a Diſcovery of the Land, that they might the more eaſily invade it. Now it is moſt certain, that theſe Spies did nothing but what they had God Almighty's Warrant for; and yet, if they had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Magiſtrates, and legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of their Deſign; Who doubts but that it had been lawful for them to have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them, according to the Law of War, and the Law of Nations? For it is none
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40650:58"/> of the Magiſtrates Buſineſs, to enquire who keeps or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes the Laws of God; (for the Law of God extends to many Caſes, where the Magiſtrate's Authority has nothing to do;) but they who tranſgreſs the Laws of the Land, and thereby diſturb the Peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are, upon a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, (without any farther Enquiry;) it being his Buſineſs to do every thing which appears to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Preſervation of the Weal-Publick, provided that he does nothing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Laws of God, who is the ſupreme King and Lord of all.</p>
                  <p n="36">
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40650:58"/>XXXVI. But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it will be objected, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's Power, yet this Doctrine which here is taught, muſt certainly defeat and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all that Authority with which the Church is endowed and inveſted. For, though the civil Magiſtrate has no more to look after but only the Peace and Preſervation of the Common-Wealth; yet ſurely it is the Duty of the Church to take Cognizance of thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted merely againſt the Law of God. But how can the Church call any Man to an Account for any Sin or Tranſgreſſion, when a Man may plead for himſelf, That he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40650:59"/> thought it was his Duty; which Plea, if really true (and who but God can diſprove it?) is ſufficient according to this Doctrine, to juſtifie him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and conſequently to indemnifie him from all Cenſures of the Church. To this I anſwer, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church <hi>(i. e.</hi> of a Chriſtian Society) is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: <hi>viz.</hi> Either that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority wherewith it is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted immediately by God, or that which is conferred on it by the civil Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Kingdom or Commonwealth. The latter of theſe is a civil Authority, though exerciſed by Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Perſons, becauſe it is derived altogether from the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40650:59"/> civil Power, And therefore, the Conſideration of it muſt be referred to what is but now ſaid touching the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. But as for that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is given to the Church immediately by God; it is evidently no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> An Authority to preach the Goſpel, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men every where to receive it; and an Authority to exclude thoſe Men out of the Society (that is, out of the viſible Communion of it) who do not profeſs the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Chriſtian Law. Other Authority than this does not appear to be given to the Church by God. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I have ſaid, does in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40650:60"/> the leaſt tend to abridge them any way as to the Exerciſe of this Power. <hi>The Church may and ought to preach the Goſpel, and perſwade men to embrace it. And however any Man may be excuſed before God by invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Ignorance, yet he is not to be ſuffered in the viſible Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, if he does not believe and live as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="37">XXXVII. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it may be objected that I have ſeveral times in this Diſcourſe made uſe of a Diſtinction, which Diſtinction is nevertheleſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd altogether uſeleſs and impertinent by the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Diſcourſe it ſelf. The Diſtinction is between <hi>neceſſary</hi> Matters of Religion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40650:60"/> and ſuch as are <hi>not neceſſary.</hi> (which is referred to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 26. and elſewhere) But if no Man can be obliged in any Matter of Religion, any farther than to do his beſt Endeavour, from thence it muſt follow, That all things are alike neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Religion. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is within a Man's Power, according to this Doctrine, is neceſſary for him; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not within his Power is not neceſſary; ſo that the very ſame thing may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Reſpect of one Man, and not neceſſary in Reſpect of another; which confounds the Diſtinction and renders it uſeleſs. To this I anſwer, That <hi>by things neceſſary I mean all ſuch as it is a Sin for a Man
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40650:61"/> to be ignorant of, if the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them be within his Power.</hi> Such as are, That <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Son of God,</hi> That <hi>God is to be worſhipped,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By things not neceſſary, I mean, Such as a Man is not obliged ſo much as to ſearch after; the lg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance whereof ſhall not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſinful before God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might have been in a Man's Power to have known them.</hi> Such are a great many curious Speculations, which Divines do trouble themſelves and the World with; which they themſelves do yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, are not neceſſary to any Man's Salvation; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, which a Man is no more obliged to trouble his Head with, than with any
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40650:61"/> Problems, either in Geometry, or Natural Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p n="38">XXXVIII. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It may be objected, That this Doctrine muſt needs encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Men to continue in their Ignorance, and not to take any Care or Pains to inform themſelves concerning the Truth of Religion, or any of the Duties of it. For, Why ſhould a Man take any Pains to get more Knowledge, (which will, it may be, bring Trouble in the Practice of it,) when Ignorance is no manner of Bar to his Salvation? For, let him but live according to the Knowledge which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready has, and God, it ſeems, requires no more from him. To this I anſwer, That <hi>for a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40650:62"/> Man to act according to the beſt of his Knowledge, will not ſerve his turn; except he has uſed his beſt Endeavour, by all Means, to know and underſtand the Will of God as perfectly as He can.</hi> (as I have ſhewn, all Men are bound to do, §. 14.) Which, though it is a Comfort to thoſe who are ignorant, and cannot help it; yet is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Encouragement or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for thoſe whoſe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is their own Fault or Neglect.</p>
                  <p n="39">XXXIX. My Reaſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus brought me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian Religion, and directed me where and how to ſeek for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines of it; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows now, that I ſhould put
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40650:62"/> this Speculation into Practice; that I would ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures with all the diligence I can, and ſet my Mind, with all its Faculties, on work, to find out as much as I am able of the Will of God, that I may the better conform my ſelf unto it. This, with God's help, I deſign ſpeedily to do: And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of my Thoughts ſhall be publiſhed to the World, if what I here write prove acceptable. But in the mean time, <hi>I think it not improper here to add ſome general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which may ſerve as Rules and Guides to me, or to any other Perſon,</hi> who ſhall ſet himſelf upon ſuch an Enquiry; <hi>to direct our
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40650:63"/> Judgments aright, to the true Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and to keep us from all Miſtakes about it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">XL. <hi>First,</hi> Then, I take it for granted, That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is calculated for Men of Reaſon and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; that is, That it is fit to ſatisfie and convince every ſober Man, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſiders the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on which it relies; and is not led aſtray by Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by Prejudice, or World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt. That this is ſo, appears very evidently from hence; Becauſe both Jeſus and his Appoſtles do appeal to the common Reaſon and Underſtandings of Men, to judge of what they taught.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40650:63"/> 
                     <hi>Yea, and why, even of your ſelves, judge ye not what is right?</hi> ſays Jeſus, <hi>Luk. 12. 57. Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Be ready always to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to every one that asketh you a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Believe not every Spirit; but try the Spirits, whether they are of God,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. Hence then I conclude, That <hi>there can be nothing in Chriſtian Religion, which contradicts the clear and evident Principles of Natural Reaſon.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a Rational Man could not be a Chriſtian. (See §. 33.)</p>
                  <p n="41">
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:40650:64"/>XLI. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears plain to me, that Chriſtian Religion was calculated, not only, nor chiefly, for Men of great and deep Learning; But alſo for thoſe of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, plain, and mean Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: That is to ſay, That there is nothing neceſſary in Chriſtianity, but what may be as well underſtood by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ordinary, illiterate Man, as by the greateſt Schollars. If this were not ſo, it would not be poſſible for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Man to be as good a Chriſtian as one that is learned: Whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is moſt apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the <hi>New Teſtament. I thank thee, O Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt hid theſe things
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40650:64"/> from the Wiſe and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes,</hi> ſays Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25. To which, the Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> do exactly agree, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. to <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. of the Second Chapter. And the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a Caution, That <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſhould not corrupt our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. And warns <hi>Timothy</hi> againſt <hi>Science, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſo called, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. But there is nothing ſo much as intimated throughout the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or any other Humane Learning, will qualifie a Man ever the better, to become a Chriſtian. I confeſs, indeed, That, as things ſtand at this time in the World, it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40650:65"/> highly convenient that the Teachers and Preachers of Chriſtianity ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently skilled in Humane Learning; that they may be the better able to defend their Religion, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, againſt thoſe who uſe ſo much Art and Skill, either to corrupt, or oppoſe it. But where a Man ſets up, not for a Teacher, but only for a true Believer, it is evident, from what has been ſaid, that he has no need of Scholarſhip; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a plain and ſober Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all neceſſary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a good Chriſtian. Or elſe, Why ſhould the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be preached ſo particularly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40650:65"/> to the <hi>Poor, Matth.</hi> 11. 5. who are commonly illiterate? And how ſhould the <hi>Poor in this World</hi> become ſo <hi>rich of Faith,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. From whence I think I may conclude, That <hi>all ſuch Doctrines, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Proof whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend either on the ſubtile Spc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Humane Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or the Niceties and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms of Grammatical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the curious Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Hiſtory and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are not to be eſteemed as neceſſary Parts of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="42">XLII. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is no leſs evident to me, that the main Deſign of Jeſus, and of his Diſciples, whom he ſent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40650:66"/> to preach the Goſpel, was, to make Men, not wiſer as to Matters of Speculation; but better, and more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to their Lives and Actions. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up; but Charity ediſieth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. Thus alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. of the ſame Epiſtle, he gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Gift of <hi>Tongues</hi> and of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and all <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> are of no value before God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Charity.</hi> And that by Charity, he means a Life led in the Practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, ſuſficiently appears by the Sequel of that Chapter. The ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. That <hi>the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40650:66"/> Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men;</hi> (For what End? To make them more wiſe, more learned, or more loſty in their Speculations? No ſuch thing: But,) <hi>teaching us, That, denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World.</hi> And, to omit a multitude of Texts, which might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in ſo plain a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I ſhall only add what we are told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6, &amp;c. That God <hi>will render unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man according to his Deeds, &amp;c.</hi> Which is a plain Demonſtration, that it is our <hi>Deeds,</hi> that is, our Practices, our Live and Converſations,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40650:67"/> that we are chiefly obliged to take care of. I grant, indeed, that God may, if he pleaſes, command things that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonial, and ſuch as have no manner of Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vertue and Morality; As undoubtedly he did unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And if he does command any ſuch things, 'tis certain that we owe Obedience to them by virtue of that Authority which God has over us. He may alſo reveal ſuch Truths as are merely ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and have nothing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical in them: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is convinced of any ſuch Revelation, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly bound to give his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the things ſo revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40650:67"/> although they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Reach of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; (as I have ſaid, §. 33.) But from what I have here ſaid, I think I may conclude, That <hi>ſince Vertue and Morality are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the chief Deſign of Chriſtianity, they ought to be chiefly regarded, and attended to by all Chriſtians. Nor ought any thing which is purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, or Speculative, to be reckoned as a neceſſary Part of Chriſtian Religion; except it appears very evidently, that God has revealed, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. Very evidently,</hi> I ſay: For, when a thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in dark and doubtful Expreſſions, it is very liable to be miſtaken; and he that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40650:68"/> is guilty of ſuch a Miſtake, can very hardly be charged with a Fault.</p>
                  <p n="43">XLIII. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Knowledge of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Attributes, and his Law, may, in part, be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (antecedent to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) is evident from Reaſon, and acknowledged by St. <hi>Paul. For the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made; even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Rom. 1. 20. <hi>(See</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. ) And <hi>when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by Nature the thiugs contained in the Law, theſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40650:68"/> having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves; which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo bearing Witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. Now although all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Religion, which may be known by the Light of Nature, are, I think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated and farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Yet becauſe it may be that this will not appear ſo plainly to every one, I think it neceſſary here to Note, That <hi>we are obliged to give our Aſſent to thoſe Truths, and our Obedience to thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40650:69"/> Laws of of Religion which we are able to diſcover by our Natural Reaſon, although the ſame ſhould not appear to us to be again repeated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For, for this very reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounces the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Gentiles to be <hi>without Excuſe, becauſe that when they knew God,</hi> that is, had ſome Knowledge of him by their natural Underſtanding, <hi>they glorified him not as God,</hi> by owning and obeying him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is it elſe but an Appeal to the natural Notions of Mankind, when he exhorts us, That <hi>whatſoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are honeſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are juſt, whatſoever
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40650:69"/> things are pure, whatſoever things are Lovely, whatſoever things are of good Report, if there be any Vertue, and if there be any Praiſe, we ſhould think on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="44">XLIV. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He that writes a Treatiſe upon any Subject, whatſoever he has a Mind that his Reader ſhould particularly obſerve and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, he will be ſure to lay it down plainly as a main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; nor will he fail (if he be diſcreet) as often as Occaſion requires, to repeat and referr to it, that the more Notice may be taken of his Meaning and Deſign. Such things as are mentioned only occaſionally and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40650:70"/> and not as any part of the main Subject of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, are not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſo much Care and Exactneſs, but that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten even the meaning of them may be miſunderſtood. Nor can we be always cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what is the true Senſe and Opinion of a Writer, from ſuch accidental Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; (which ſometimes may be uſed figuratively, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by way of Alluſion or Accommodation, ſometimes with Reference to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regard to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Truth of them) except he gives us fome farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Mind. From
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40650:70"/> whence I think I may conclude, That <hi>the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Doctrines and Precepts of Chriſtian Religion, are not to be gachered from thoſe collateral and occaſional Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which are ſcattered up and down in the Scriptures; but from the main Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the whole Bible in general, and of each Book of it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="45">XLV. I have thus briefly and plainly given, I hope, a rational Account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and of Chriſtianity in general. If I find that what I have here writ is likely to do any good in the World, I ſhall proceed, with God's Aſſiſtance, to draw out and

                  <head>A Short PREFACE To the whole.</head>
                  <p>SOme Men ſlight Religion, whilſt others corru and perplex it with things either falſe or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; the later of
<pb facs="tcp:40650:75"/> which I look upon to be much the cauſe of the former.</p>
                  <p>Many will not take the pains to read much; and many do not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, nor will digeſt what they read; which renders their Notions confuſed, and themſelves uncertain what to conclude.</p>
                  <p>I have thereſore
<pb facs="tcp:40650:75"/> endeavoured to make ſuch a ſhort and eaſy Draught of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Grounds of it, as every Man of a moderate Capacity may read without Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand without Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And which, if it does not wholly ſatisfie him, may yet ſerve to put his Thoughts into
<pb facs="tcp:40650:76"/> a Method, and himſelf upon ſeeking for farther Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Part of this ſmall Work I put forth ſome time ſince; and, finding that it has not proved altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unacceptable to Men of Judgment and Moderation, I have been encouraged to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and publiſh the
<pb facs="tcp:40650:76"/> Second and Third Parts alſo.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly good; and if I have not well performed what I have undertaken, I hope at leaſt that what I have here done, may move ſome more able and Judicious Perſon to take the Work in hand, and ſupply thoſe Defects of which I have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <head>THE CONTINUATION OF A <hi>Gentleman's Religion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head>Being the Second PART.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Holy Scriptures</hi> being the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Record that I am able to find of the Chriſtian Religion, I take it for granted that they <hi>do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Divine Matters really and truly as the things are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40650:79"/> but believe that all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin therein delivered is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly true, altho many times I am not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Deſign and. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Expreſſions and Paſſages which do occur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I think it indeed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper, that Men of any reaſonable Learning and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould modeſtly offer their Thoughts to the World, in order to the explaining of ſuch Places of the Scriptures as appear to be abſtruſe and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: <hi>But he who ſpeaks his own Words</hi> (and not thoſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>can therein only offer his own Apprehenſions;</hi> to which no Man can be obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, any farther than as he is in his own Reaſon convinced
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40650:79"/> of the Truth of them, and their Conſonancy with the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I do not apprehend that an implicit Faith is due to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges it (Part 1. §. 21.) much leſs ſure to any other Church which does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. <hi>When,</hi> therefore, <hi>any Church, much more when any private Men, do offer me any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Religion in their own Words, I think I ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Firſt, <hi>Whether what they ſay is intelligible:</hi> (For tho we may be obliged to believe ſuch things as are above our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to comprehend, (Part 1. §. 33.) yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Man to give an explicit Aſſent to any Form
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:80"/> of Words, if he does not Know the meaning of them.) Secondly, <hi>Whether it is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſelf-evident Principles of Reaſon,</hi> for, If I apprehend it to be otherwiſe, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to believe it. (Part 1. §. 33.) Nor muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Text of Scripture be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted above the Level of plain and ſelf-evident Reaſon, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the literal Senſe may ſeem to be. <hi>And,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>whether the Truth of it can be proved by any ſolid Argument,</hi> either from Reaſon or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for tho a Doctrin be both intelligible and poſſible, yet ſtill it may be falſe; and therefore is not to be believed except it can be proved. Theſe Rules I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:80"/> ſtrictly to obſerve in the Trial of thoſe Doctrins which I am now about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and I deſire my Reader carefully to make uſe of the ſame, in the Examination of all that I ſhall offer unto him. But here I muſt deſire him to take notice, that I do fuppoſe him to be well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, and alſo with the common Arguments, upon which the ſeveral Parties of Chriſtians do ground and maintain their Opinions: And therefore, for his Eaſe, as well as my own, I ſhall ſave my ſelf the Labour of mentioning ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Places of Scripture, as are uſually brought to prove thoſe Points which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40650:81"/> acknowledged by all Chriſtians, and even in thoſe Points which are controverted between different Parties, I ſhall ordinarily think it enough to hint at ſome of thoſe Texts, and Arguments, which are uſed on either ſide; of which I can ſcarce ſuppoſe any Man to be ignorant that is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately acquainted with the Principles of Chriſtianity, and the ſeveral Parties that profeſs it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To believe what God makes known, and to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is</hi> what all Men call <hi>Religion:</hi> But things that are impoſſible, 'tis certain that God requires from no Man (Part 1. §. 14.) <hi>When</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Damnation is denounced</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:81"/> in Scripture <hi>againſt thoſe who receive not the Goſpel, it muſt needs be underſtood only of them in whoſe Power it was to have received it;</hi> and not of ſuch who are invincibly ignorant; either for want of Capacity, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. or of the means of Knowledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. But for a Man who has both the Capacity and Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, through Negligence, to continue in Ignorance of God's Will, my Reaſon tells me is a very great Sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all thoſe Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which do require us dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ſeek after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That <hi>there is a God,</hi> is ſufficiently to be proved from our own Reaſon and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:82"/> 
                     <hi>But fully to comprehend his Nature,</hi> or declare in all Points what he is, <hi>is by all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be impoſſible to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That <hi>God never had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> I think I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded (Part 1. §. 6.) And, if the holy Scripture had not told me that he is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting; yet my own Reaſon would have inferred that <hi>he is ſubject to no Decay, nor ever ſhall have an Ending.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Nature of every Material Being ſeems neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to imply a Poſſibility of having its Parts disjoyned and ſeparated one from another; and conſequently of being diſſolved and deſtroyed: And thereſore I conclude, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:82"/> eternal <hi>God does not conſiſt of Matter;</hi> and that Being which is intelligent, and does not conſiſt of any material Parts, I call a Spirit: And this is what I mean when I ſay that <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> As for thoſe Expreſſions <hi>the Eyes of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Arm of the Lord,</hi> and ſuch like, which do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſometimes in Scripture, and ſeem to imply Bodily Parts, it is manifeſtly obvious that they muſt be purely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our Experience does ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifie that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is viſible to us, is ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Since therefore <hi>God</hi> does not conſiſt of Matter, I conclude that he <hi>is inviſible to Mortal Eyes,</hi> as the Scripture
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:83"/> poſitively declares him to be: And all thoſe Texts which ſeem to ſay, that he has been ſeen by Man, I think muſt of neceſſity be interpreted ſome other way, <hi>viz.</hi> either, 1. Of an Angel appearing in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and majeſtatick manner: Or 2. Of the eternal Son of God aſſuming a Bodily Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as after he took our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him: Or, 3. Of ſome viſible and extraordinary Signs and Tokens that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God was there preſent in an extraordinary Manner: Or, 4. Of thoſe myſtical and Hieroglyphical Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God has ſometimes been pleaſed to make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to the Senſes, but to the Imagination and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:83"/> of his Prophets, in their extatick Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Amongſt all thoſe things which I can conceive poſſible to be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> to imply no Contradiction, I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which to me appears more difficult, than what God has already done in the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Univerſe: And therefore I conclude, that <hi>God</hi> can do whatſoever in its ſelf is poſſible to be done, which is what I mean when I ſay, that <hi>he is Almighty:</hi> Nor is there any one, ſure, who will venture to ſay, that God can do ſuch things as imply a Contradiction, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to his own Nature and Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:84"/>9. That God, who made all things, ſhould be ignorant of any thing, appears to me moſt abſurd to imagine. But when I ſay, that <hi>God is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient;</hi> If there is any thing, the Knowledge of which would manifeſtly imply a Contradiction, it could ſurely be no greater Irreverence to ſay, that God could not know, than that he could not do ſuch a thing. But whether the Knowledge of a future Contingent would imply a Contradiction or not, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſtruſe and metaphyſical Diſpute; and except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary can very clearly be made appear, I know not how to imagine that God is, or can be ignorant of any thing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:84"/> paſt, preſent, or to come, however contingent.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If God were or could be confined to, or circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in any determinate Space or Place, it would be hard to conceive that his Knowledge and Power ſhould be infinite, and extend to all Places. But I cannot ſuppoſe God to be preſent in all Places aſter the ſame manner, as the Air is every where preſent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Region, or the Light throughout its Hemiſphere, for that would imply local Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; and conſequently, that he were a material Being, contrary to what I have ſaid, §. 6. But that God can in an inſtant exert his Power in any, or all Places, whenever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40650:85"/> (as the Soul can on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den move the extreameſt Joynt of the Body) is, I think, an evident Conſequence of his Omnipotence; and that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Exiſtence whereby he is able to do this, I call Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence; and this is all that I am able to conceive when I ſay that <hi>God is every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. That <hi>God is moſt wiſe,</hi> that is to ſay, moſt perfectly knows what is always fitteſt and beſt to be done, and which is the propereſt way to bring what he pleaſes to paſs, is an evident Conſequence from his Omniſcience, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed a Branch of it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. From God's Wiſdom it neceſſarily follows, that his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:85"/> 
                     <hi>Counſel is unchangeable.</hi> For he who alters or repents of any thing, which he has once poſitively determined, plainly ſhews his Foreſight to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and his Wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. When therefore we meet with ſome Paſſages in Scripture which ſeem to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that God has decreed one thing, and yet afterwards done another; we muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty underſtand ſuch Decrees to have been not abſolute, but merely conditional (a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being in many Caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and ſuppoſed, where it is not in Words expreſſed.) And when he is ſaid to have repented of ſome things which he has done, or to have been grieved thereat, we muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40650:86"/> needs interpret ſuch Places in a metaphorical Senſe, with an Alluſion to thoſe Motions and Paſſions in Mankind; juſt as <hi>Hands, Arms, Eyes, &amp;c.</hi> are on the ſame account ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſcribed unto him, tho really he has no ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, no more than he has the Paſſions, which belong to Men.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I do moſt evidently find in my ſelf a Power to chooſe at all times what I pleaſe, and to determine my own Actions as I will my ſelf: And this I look upon to be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection in me, than if I were abſolutely neceſſitated and determined by ſomewhat without my ſelf, in every thing which I ſhould do.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40650:86"/> Since therefore I derive this Perfection originally from God, who is the Contriver and Author of my Being, (Part 1. §. 7.) I cannot but aſcribe the ſame in the higheſt Degree to him, who muſt be the Fountain of all Perfection. And therefore I moſt readily believe that <hi>God is a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi> and worketh all things after the Counſel of his own Will.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. How Juſtice, in a ſtrict Senſe, is to be aſcribed unto God, who ows nothing to any one, and has a ſupreme and moſt abſolute Dominion over all things, as having made them purely at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Will, I look upon to be a nice and uſeleſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40650:87"/> Diſquiſition: But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Juſtice, which Men are obliged to obſerve one to another, to me do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſo very reaſonable, that I cannot apprehend why any one, of Knowledge and Underſtanding, ſhould ever va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from them, except there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might propoſe either to advance his Intereſt, compaſs his Pleaſure, or wreck his Malice; neither of which I can imagine to have any Place in God. I therefore conclude that <hi>God is Juſt,</hi> even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common Rules of Juſtice and Equity, as far as they can be applied to him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Veracity to me appears to be no leſs agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40650:87"/> than Juſtice, if it be not rather a Part of it: And ſince I am able to imagin no Shadow of a Reaſon why God ſhould declare any thing which were falſe; I cannot but believe that <hi>he is moſt true</hi> in all that he ſays.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That God ſhould hate thoſe Creatures which he has made (except they by their evil Actions and Diſobedience do deſerve it) is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And as he who loves another is always ready to pardon his Faults (eſpecially if they have any way proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only from Frailty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity) upon his true and ſincere Repentance; ſo if the Perſon beloved continues ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and incorrigible in his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40650:88"/> Tranſgreſſions, he, with all the Reaſon that can be, ſorſeits that Love which he once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and juſtly incurs ſuch Penalty as may be ſuitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Obligations which he has broken, and the Quality of the Perſon he has offended. I therefore conclude, That <hi>God has originally a Love for all Mankind,</hi> and that he <hi>will be always merciful unto ſuch Sinners as are truly penitent; but ſtrict and ſevere in the Puniſhment of thoſe who go on in the Breach of his Laws without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Nor are thoſe Calamities which ſo often follow us in this Life, or God's viſiting the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children</hi> (which can be underſtood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40650:88"/> of temporal Afflictions) <hi>or his puniſhing the wicked with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and everlasting Miſery, any manner of Derogation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Juſtice, or his Love and Mercy towards Mankind,</hi> ſince temporal Afflictions may well be looked on as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Love, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to wean and purge us from the Love and Filth of this World, and to make us more fit for Heaven; and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation (of which we have fair warning given us, and may therefore avoid it if we pleaſe) is as little as can be threatened (and often is but too little) to keep us back from all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40650:89"/>18. That ſome ſort of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are eternally and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, that is to ſay, to be approved of by every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial rational Being <hi>(e. g.</hi> to love him from whom we derive our Exiſtence, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Promiſe, and ſuch like) and that the contrary Actions hereunto are therefore eſſentially and eternally evil, is to me from hence ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced, becauſe that if all Beings, which are endowed with Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould univerſally ſet themſelves to do thoſe things which now are accounted evil, and to omit thoſe things which now are eſteemed good; the Conſequence of this muſt neceſſarily-be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40650:89"/> Confuſion and Miſery. Now that God loves and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of all Actions that are good, does evidently appear, becauſe ſuch Actions do tend to the general Happineſs of his Creatures, whom he loves, §. 16. and for the contrary Reaſon it will follow, that he hates and abhors all Actions that are evil. And this is what I mean when I ſay, That <hi>God is most holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. All poſſible Excellency or Perfection that I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is reducible unto theſe Five Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Being, which conſiſts in perpetual Duration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Decay or Infirmity. 2. Perfection of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which conſiſts in ſuch
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40650:90"/> Knowledg and Wiſdom as is free all Miſtake or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 3. Perfection of the Will, which conſiſts in a free Liberty to chooſe or refuſe, without any Conſtraint or fatal Neceſſity. 4. Perfection of Power, which conſiſts in an Ability to do every thing. And 5. Moral Perfection, which conſiſts in an inflexible Reſolution always to do and encourage that which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, and to avoid and diſcourage whatſoever is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally evil. Now, ſince all theſe Perfections are in God in the moſt abſolute manner; as I think I have ſhewn in the foregoing Paragraphs, from hence it will follow, That <hi>God is moſt abſolutely perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40650:90"/>20. And ſince he who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect can ſtand in need of nothing; it muſt alſo follow, that <hi>God is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy in Himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. As my Reaſon do's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonſtrate unto me the Being of a God, ſo does it not in the leaſt ſuggeſt to me any Argument to conclude that <hi>there is</hi> any more <hi>but One God:</hi> And it is abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to multiply Beings without any Ground or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. That there is a real, and not only a nominal Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit; that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpoken of in the Holy Scriptures in ſuch Terms as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40650:91"/> we ordinarily uſe when we ſpeak of Three Perſons (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho ſometimes this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Holy Ghoſt or Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, may be put to ſignifie not ſo much the Perſon, as the Power, Effect or Energy of God's Spirit) That, altho the Son be often ſpoken of as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly a Man, yet many things are ſaid of him which cannot agree to a meer Man, or to any created Being whatſoever; and that there are ſuch things alſo ſpoken of the Holy Ghoſt, as cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Moreover, that the Son derives his Being from, and always depends upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Holy Ghoſt does from, and upon the Father
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40650:91"/> and the Son: All theſe things, I ſay, in my Opinion, are not to be denyed by any one, who will but interpret the Holy Scriptures according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Senſe and Signification of the Words thereof, and not according to his own Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices or preconceived Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And altho the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do clearly enough expound ſome of thoſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, with more Zeal than Reaſon, are ſometimes urged againſt them; yet, as to the principal Paſſages, which are alleged to prove what I have now aſſerted. I think their Interpretation of them not only to be harſh and ſtrained (which in a manner is acknowledged even by their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40650:92"/> own acute and brief Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, in the laſt Paragraph of his ſecond Letter) but alſo, many times, to be utterly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable unto the Words and Context. And now (to explain thoſe Conceptions which ariſe in my Mind upon the Conſideration of the Texts here hinted at, as well as, in a Matter ſo abſtruſe and remote from my Senſes, I am able) ſince I cannot find a more proper Term to expreſs the Diſtinction of <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt</hi> by, <hi>I call</hi> them <hi>Three Perſons; and,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what other Title to give a Divine Perſon who is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>I call each Perſon God: But I give the Title of God in a more emphatical manner unto
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40650:92"/> the Father than unto the Son or Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe the Father depends on none, but they do depend on him: <hi>And,</hi> ſince both my Reaſon and the Holy Scriptures do teach me to own no more than one God, I am of neceſſity compelled to ſay that <hi>theſe Three are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together</hi> (tho in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is above my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) <hi>as to be but one God.</hi> And altho it argues a great deal of Imperfection in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Speech, that, for want of other fit and proper Terms, we are forced to give the ſame Appellation to each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſingly, and to the Three conjointly; yet this does not imply any manner of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as ſome do object;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40650:93"/> becauſe, when we apply the Word <hi>God</hi> to one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it has not the ſame <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> and <hi>adequate</hi> Signification, as when we aſcribe it unto the Three Perſons conjointly (for that would imply that each ſingle Perſon were, at the ſame time, the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſo confound that Diſtinction which the Holy Scriptures do ſo often and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently make between them:) And this analogical Difference, in the Signification of the Word <hi>God,</hi> will eaſily ſolve moſt of thoſe Objections which the <hi>Socinians</hi> do bring againſt the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And becauſe I know no better Word to expreſs that Unity which I apprehend to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40650:93"/> be between the <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> I therefore ſay, that they <hi>are One in Eſſence</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For Unity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or Conſent alone, does not ſeem enough to me to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them to be One God. And becauſe I find that <hi>the Son is ſaid to be begotten, and the Holy Ghoſt to proceed,</hi> or be ſent, or emitted; I therefore make uſe of theſe Terms, without pretending to aſſign the Difference between Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Proceſſion: And altho <hi>the Son and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> being each of them God, <hi>are,</hi> and muſt needs be, <hi>of the ſame Nature, and,</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>equal with the Father;</hi> yet it is manifeſt that this Equality muſt be underſtood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40650:94"/> with an Allowance for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Independence of the Father, and the Dependence of the Son and Holy Ghoſt upon him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. All the Objections that I can remember to be made againſt the Doctrin of the Trinity thus ſtated, I think, are eaſie enough to be ſolved by what I have now ſaid, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Two, which muſt be particularly anſwered. The firſt is taken from <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 33. &amp;c. But tho our Saviour did not here aſſert his Divinity when there ſeemed to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that therefore he is not God: Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it was not always his Cuſtom to give full and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40650:94"/> compleat Anſwers unto ſuch captious Queſtions and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as were put to him: But ſometimes he contented himſelf only with ſhewing the Unreaſonableneſs of thoſe who propoſed them; of which we have one Inſtance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23. &amp;c. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 3. &amp;c. and, as ſome think, another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 17. &amp;c. And we may as well conclude, that he had no Authority for what he did, becauſe he did not declare it when the Chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders queſtioned it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23. as deny his Divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not expreſly maintain it, when on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was charged with Blaſphemy. The other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40650:95"/> is drawn from <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 32. But to it I anſwer, That our Saviour's Deſign, in that Place, being only to repreſent the Day there ſpoken of as a Secret not to be made known unto Men until it ſhould come upon them; that they might always ſtand upon their Guard, watch, and prepare for it: Let but the Word <hi>know</hi> be taken to ſignifie to <hi>make known</hi> (which fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Deſign of the Place, and, as it is evident, St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes the ſame Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Idetermined,</hi> ſays he, <hi>not to know,</hi> that is, not to make known or teach, <hi>any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Christ, and him crucified:</hi> and then the moſt natural Paraphraſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40650:95"/> of that Place will be this, <hi>But that Day and Hour there is no one who ſhall or can make known unto you; no not the Angels which are in Heaven;</hi> (who may be ſuppoſed to be ignorant of it themſelves) <hi>nor even the Son himſelf</hi> (who altho he <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things,</hi> Joh. 21. 17. yet <hi>can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do,</hi> Joh. 5. 19. And <hi>who ſpeaketh not of himſelf, but the Father which ſent him gave him Commandment what he ſhould ſay,</hi> Joh. 12. 49.) <hi>But the Father only ſhall in his own time, make it known by bringing it to paſs.</hi> And this Expoſition of this Place of Scripture (which is the <hi>only</hi> Text that ſeems to preſs very hard upon us in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40650:96"/> I am ſure, is much more eaſie and natural, than <hi>many</hi> of thoſe Interpretations, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, of the principal Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which we urge againſt them. But if any one ſhall tell me, that this whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Trinity, is very obſcure and difficult to be apprehended; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is unreaſonable to require the explicit Belief of ſuch Doctrin, as neceſſary, either to Salvation or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion: As to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſince, in this Life, <hi>we know</hi> but <hi>in part, and propheſie in part,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> but <hi>through a Glaſs darkly,</hi> or <hi>in a Riddle,</hi> as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40650:96"/> the Margin has it Word for Word from the Original, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 12. As to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, I ſhall ſpeak of it hereafter in its proper Place: And as touching Salvation, I refer my Reader to what I have ſaid, §. 3. and Part 1. §. 14. and §. 26.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Either the Matter of this viſible World did from all Eternity coexiſt together with God, or elſe it was produced from Nothing by him, there being no Third Way to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: Now both theſe Ways being above, tho nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them contrary to my Reaſon; my Reaſon alone can never ſolidly determine which of them is the right. But the later of theſe making
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40650:97"/> moſt, in my Opinion, for the Honour of God (of whom, as being the moſt perfect Being, I think I ought to entertain the moſt glorious Thoughts that poſſibly I can;) and the Holy Scriptures ſo often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing Eternity without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning unto God, in an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical manner, as his alone peculiar Attribute, I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought to believe, that <hi>the Matter of this World</hi> is not eternal, but <hi>was at firſt created by God from Nothing; and</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that <hi>God can again annihilate it, or any Part of it,</hi> if it ſhould ſo pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. That <hi>God did contrive, frame and faſhion this World,</hi> and every part of it, <hi>and</hi> alſo that <hi>he ſtill preſerves and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40650:97"/> it by his Providence,</hi> I have formerly concluded, Part 1. § 7. and §. 10. And tho every ignorant Perſon is not able to dive into, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the Counſels of a great and Sovereign Prince; yet this is no Argument that he does not manage and rule his Dominions with due Care and Wiſdom: Nor could the making, nor can the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World be any manner of Trouble to God (as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> objected) ſince he is abſolutely Omnipotent, and needs no more but to ſpeak the Word and the thing is done.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. It is very evident that the Heathen World its ſelf was generally and ſtrongly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40650:98"/> to the Belief of certain Beings (ſome good and ſome evil) ſuperiour in Nature to Man, but ſubject to, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſupreme God. But the Holy Scriptures do give us a more full and perfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God created certain Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Beings, called Angels;</hi> that is to ſay, Meſſengers, as being ſent forth by him to execute his Will upon all Occaſions that he thinks fit; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (not that God has any need of their Aſſiſtance or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, any more than he has of the Worſhip and Service of Man; but only thought fit to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40650:98"/> create them of his own good Will and Pleaſure: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that they, as well as Man, might be Objects for him to exerciſe his Goodneſs and Beneficence upon.) But whether every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, State and Kingdom have their proper Guardian Angels, appointed them by God, is not, as I can find, upon any ſure Grounds to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>But</hi> we are farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that <hi>of theſe Angels ſome ſinned, and therefore kept not their firſt Eſtate,</hi> but were caſt down into Hell, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment; <hi>the Chief,</hi> or Prince <hi>of whom is called the Devil,</hi> the great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, the old Serpent and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40650:99"/> 
                     <hi>and is,</hi> together with his Angels, <hi>permitted by God to range to and fro in the Earth, to tempt even the Godly, but to prevail and work in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. That an eternal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Men, or any other Beings, without a Beginning, is abſolutely impoſſible, I have, I think with Reaſon, already ſaid, Part 1. §. 6. That Man at firſt was not faſhioned by any blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned Chance, is to me very evident, as well from the wonderful Frame of his Mind, as from the great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, Regularity and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all the Parts of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and particularly his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Senſation: And that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40650:99"/> he did not at firſt ſpring up out of the Earth by any Force of Nature, diſtinct from the Power of God, I think needs no Proof, becauſe the contrary Suppoſition is not only without any Ground of Evidence, but alſo liable to ſo many monſtrous Improbabilities as do render it hightly extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant to imagine. I therefore muſt conclude, That (at the leaſt) <hi>the firſt Male and Female of Mankind were immediately framed and faſhioned by God; and</hi> that <hi>all the reſt of them were and are derived from thoſe two by the way of natural Generation</hi> (Chriſt Jeſus excepted, who tho born of a Woman, was not begotten of a Man) is the plain Voice of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:40650:100"/>28. That Man, tho made a little lower than the Angls, is yet by Nature far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than any other living Creature, is ſufficiently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The Holy Scripture tells us, that God made Man after his own Image: But this Expreſſion cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with reſpect to the Shape and Structure of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body (God being both incorporeal and inviſible) but is, as I apprehend it, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe Faculties which are implanted in the Mind of Man, and that internal Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs in which he was at firſt created; which do carry in them an evident Similitude and Analogy unto ſome of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40650:100"/> thoſe Attributes and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in God himſelf. That <hi>the Body of Man is made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally of the Earth,</hi> by which it is nouriſhed, and into which it is again reſolved, is obvious to be collected from Reaſon: <hi>And</hi> if I had never been told that <hi>God breathed into his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils the Breath of Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became a Living Soul,</hi> yet thoſe Powers and Faculties which I find in my ſelf, of Thinking, Judging, Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſequences (and thoſe ſometimes in a very long Train) reflecting back upon my own Thoughts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining my own Actions as I pleaſe, together with that inward Satisfaction which I reap from doing what is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40650:101"/> good, tho naturally and to my Body painful and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; and the Trouble which I find upon the doing of any thing which is morally evil, tho otherwiſe never ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful, would, I think, have ſufficiently taught and aſſured me, that there is a Principle within me, which, tho united to my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (and thereby affected with its Delights or Pains) yet is really diſtinct from it, and of a different Nature and more noble Original, which I call my Soul.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That God, who has originally a Love for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, §. 16. ſhould have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated any Man with an Intent to make him eternally and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40650:101"/> unavoidably miſerable, is to me a Contradiction: And ſince, on the contrary, he has naturally implanted in every Man a vehement and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable Deſire of being Happy, and of always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſo, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>God intended Man at his first Creation unto eternal Happineſs.</hi> For that he ſhould implant the Seed and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch a Deſire in us all, which never fails to ſpring forth and ſhew its ſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man who comes to Years of Knowledge; and this to be only a Torment to us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Poſſibility either of ſuppreſſing or ſatisfying it; is, I think, not to be conceived, except we ſhould ſuppoſe that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40650:102"/> at the firſt he made us to be Objects, not of his Love, but Hatred.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. As even by the Ruins of a noble Structure we may be able to give a Gueſs how goodly the Building was at its firſt Erection; ſo when I at preſent conſider how diſtorted the Nature of Man is (his Luſts and Paſſions always ſtrugling with, and often get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Victory over his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which evidently was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſuperiour Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) own my Underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone methinks ſuggeſts to me, that <hi>Man was at first created in a more perfect and upright State and Condition than what he is in at preſent: But</hi> how <hi>our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was</hi> ſo far <hi>perverted,</hi> as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40650:102"/> that all our Reaſon and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours cannot again reduce it to that firm and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, in which we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ought to be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have cauſe to believe that it was at firſt framed by God, is what of our ſelves we never could have collected from any Suggeſtions of our own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Whether the ſecond and third Chapters of the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> are all to be underſtood literally, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an allegorical Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in ſome parts to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I think my ſelf not much concerned to debate. But, which way ſoever we take, the plain Reſult will be, that whereas God placed our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40650:103"/> firſt Parents, at their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a ſtate both of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Happineſs; they by tranſgreſſing his Law, and thereby incurring his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſell both from the one and the other. Now that they, by their ſin, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave their own Natures, and vitiate their Conſtitutions, is no way irrational to ſuppoſe: And that from the depraved Nature and vitiated Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parents divers incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences may be entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Poſterity (who do derive not only their bodily Temper and Complection, but frequently alſo their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Inclinations from thoſe of their Parents) is what common Experience does dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40650:103"/> teſtifie. When therefore <hi>the Holy Scripture aſſigns the ſin of our firſt Parents, as the Cauſe of the Corruption of the Nature of Mankind,</hi> I ſee nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which is not very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be allowed.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. He who grants a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to another, barely and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own free will and pleaſure, may without any violation of Juſtice, whenever he pleaſes, withdraw that, which he is under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to continue any longer than he thinks fit. Nor is it any way to be reckoned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful or cruel, to ceaſe the continuance of a purely volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary kindneſs, if the ſtopping of it does not render the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon actually miſerable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40650:104"/> any fault committed by him. If therefore God had thought fit, even for no other reaſon but his own Pleaſure, to divert the ſtream of his kindneſs from Man; and that altho he had continued in a State of Innocency, provided he had not put him into a ſtate of unavoidable Miſery; who could have any juſt reaſon to complain, or find fault with him for doing what he ſhould pleaſe with his own? Much more then will it follow that, If upon the occaſon of our firſt Parents Tranſgreſſion, and the Corruption of our Nature which thereupon enſued, God had reſolved to cut us all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever off from the inheritance of thoſe Bleſſings to which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40650:104"/> Man was deſigned at his firſt creation, but now rendred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unfit for, by this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal pollution; even in this there had been nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſtrict Rules of Juſtice or Mercy: Eſpecially if we conſider, that all the World have ever thought it reaſonable that, in ſome caſes, Children ſhould, on account of their Parents Faults, loſe ſome benefits and advantages which otherwiſe they would have enjoyed. But actually to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a poſitive Puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one for a Fault which he never committed, nor any way voluntarily concurred to, nor was at all capable of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in him who committed it, being ſo directly contrary,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40650:105"/> not only unto Mercy, but alſo to the common Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; I can not but conclude, that <hi>tho' the original Corruption of our Nature may be reckoned as a juſt occaſion why God might.</hi> if he had pleaſed, <hi>have exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us all for ever from the Joys of Heaven; Yet that alone is not to be aſſigned as a Cauſe why he will doom any Man to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell,</hi> who does not otherwiſe deſerve it, by his own actual ſins and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. That by the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Nature we are all of us mightily inclined to things that are evil and immoral, is moſt evident from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Experience: But that we have not thereby loſt all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40650:105"/> knowledge and power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is good, I think is no leſs apparent from the Writings and Examples of ſo many brave Heathens; Who having no other Divine Law but that which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Hearts by the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of their natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet both taught and did ſo many of the things contained in the written Law of God. But curiouſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and aſſign the Bounds between Nature and Grace (which are both the Gifts of God; the one in an ordinary, the other in an extraordinary way) and to pretend to ſhew how far we may go by the bare ſtrength of Nature, and where it is that we juſt ſtand
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40650:106"/> in need of ſupernatural Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I look upon to be a work of very little uſe or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; but of extraordinary difficulty, and perhaps impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to perform. Moreover, how God will deal with thoſe who have no other Guide to follow but the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; How far he will puniſh their Sins, be merciful to their Ignorance or Infirmities, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their endeavours to do good, is a Secret of which we are no way able to give any particular account. But it may ſuffice us to know, that the Generation of <hi>Mankind by reaſon of the Corruption of their Nature being apparently in a worſe condition in reſpect of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40650:106"/> Salvation, than what they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would have been; God</hi> was pleaſed to determine that he <hi>would not deal with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty which he had over them, nor according to the ſtrict and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Rules of Juſtice,</hi> which might have juſtified the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Severities; <hi>but according to the inclinations of his Mercy and Loving kindneſs.</hi> Of which way of Gods proceeding with us, I come now to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. That God might, if he had pleaſed, without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any of his Attributes, have freely forgiven all the Sins of Mankind, and even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored our Nature again to its primitive Integrity and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40650:107"/> ſeems naturally to follow both from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Almightineſs of his Power: And even the ſtricteſt Juſtice, tho it fully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, yet does not compel any one to exact a Debt where he is the only Creditour, or a Puniſhment where he is the only party injured or offended. But if <hi>God has thought fit</hi> to deal after another manner with us; and <hi>rather</hi> offers <hi>to help our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, as occaſion requires, than wholly to repair our pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature; and chooſes to have an Expiation made for our Sins, rather than to remit them without any ſuch conſideration;</hi> Altho his Will and Pleaſure is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſilence all our Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40650:107"/> and juſtifie his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yet may there ſome probable Conſiderations be urged in order to make us clearly apprehend the Wiſdom of God in the fitneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: As namely, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are, or ought to be made more continually ſenſible of our conſtant Dependence upon him, of his great Mercy and Compaſſion for us, of his perfect Hatred and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. It cannot, I think, be doubted but that, at the very time of the Fall of man, God, who is infinitly wiſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore ſtands in need of no time to deliberate, had fully determined what he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40650:108"/> would do in order to the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our Sins, and the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our corrupted Nature, ſo as that we might be again in ſome capacity of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Happineſs to which we were at firſt deſigned, §. 29. And that this work of <hi>our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was to be performed by the Means and Mediation of</hi> an extraordinary Perſon, who was to be ſent into the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of the Meſſiah, or the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is abundantly evident, both from the Old and New Teſtament; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we compare them and expound them one by another. But it is certain, that Chriſt did not immediately come into the World; nor was there any one for ſome Thouſands of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40650:108"/> Years after the Fall, who ſo much as pretended to that Title or Office; Whether it were, that God thought it fit by ſome previous Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prepare the Minds of Men for the reception of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a Perſon, or for what other reaſon, I pretend not to determine; but think my ſelf obliged intirely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Wiſdom of God, who thought fit ſo to order it, that the Meſſiah ſhould not appear until that fulneſs of time which he had appointed for it. In the mean while, altho the great Light was not yet to come into the World, yet God ſuffered it not to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overſpread with Darkneſs; But beſides the Light of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40650:109"/> viſible Creation, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Glory and eternal Power of God; and beſides the natural Light which ariſes in every Mans Underſtanding, whereby they who have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, are a Law unto themſelves, unto which their own Conſcience is a Witneſs beyond exception; God was pleaſed in a ſupernatural way to reveal himſelf unto divers perſons (to the intent that they might teach the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him to others) as to <hi>Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Job,</hi> and probably to many more than we read of (Amongſt whom, why <hi>Baalam</hi> ſhould not be reckoned, I can ſee no reaſon; altho Covetouſneſs and the hopes of worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40650:109"/> tempted him to make but an ill uſe of the good Gifts of God) And alſo to chuſe out unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, namely that of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and to vouchſafe unto them a more than ordinary knowledge of Himſelf and his Laws, by his Servants <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: And laſtly by his Providence to order the matter ſo, that the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ſhould many years before Chriſts coming, be tranſlated into the Greek tongue (which was then the moſt univerſal Language) that by them all Nations might have the more Inſtruction, and ſo be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared to receive the Meſſiah, whenever he ſhould
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40650:110"/> be made known unto them. And for this reaſon alſo it ſeems to be, that God ſo long before the Moſaick Law, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of Beaſts; whereby it became the common practice of the Gentiles, as well as Jews: Not that he had any eſteem or value for the Blood of Bulls or of Goats; but only that by this practice the Minds of Men might be the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily diſpoſed to own and rely upon that great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which Chriſt was one day to make of Himſelf for them.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. There are ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies diſperſed up and down through the Old Teſtament, plainly deſigned to foretel the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40650:110"/> coming of the Chriſt or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, what ſort of perſon he ſhould be, and what he ſhould do and ſuffer: As that he ſhould be the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of the Progeny of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of the Family and Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>David,</hi> born in <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> and born of a Virgin: That he ſhould come into the World about the time that the Scepter and the Law-giver, that is to ſay, the force and power of civil Authority, ſhould ceaſe from the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſhould finiſh his Work in the compaſs of the laſt ſeven Years of thoſe Four hundred and ninety, which are pointed out by the Prophet <hi>Daniel;</hi> That by many he ſhould be deſpiſed and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40650:111"/> ſhould be a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and acquainted with Griefs, be oppreſſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, yet bear it moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and at laſt be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cut off, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And yet for all this he is foretold to be a perſon won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, a Counſellour, the mighty God, the Prince of Peace, of the increaſe of whoſe Government there ſhould be no end, and unto whom the gathering of the Nations ſhould be. Now altho there may ſome Difficulties be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the Interpretation of ſome of thoſe and ſuch like Prophecies, which do occurr in the Old Teſtament (which is no great wonder, conſidering
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40650:111"/> how the Jews, who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſtianity, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obſcure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex them) yet if we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that there is evidently a fair, conſonant and reaſonable Application of all theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to be made unto Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and that there is not, nor ever was any other perſon to whom they could be applied, beſides himſelf; and ſince it is not poſſible for any one, but God, to foretell a thing with ſo many circumſtances ſo long before it comes to paſs, I think I may very well from hence conclude, not only againſt the Jews, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but alſo againſt all others, who may perhaps at firſt deny the Authority of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40650:112"/> the Old Teſtament, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth is the Chriſt</hi> or Meſſiah, whom God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend into the World: And if to this we add the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Miracles, and the tranſcendent Goodneſs of his Doctrine (of which ſee Part 1. §. 19) I think the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will have the force of a Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. In the Holy Scriptures I find ſuch things ſpoken of Chriſt as do plainly ſhew him to have been a true and real Man; in all things like unto us, ſin only excepted: Other Expreſſions alſo I find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applyed to him, which cannot poſſibly agree to any Man, or created Being whatſoever, but only unto
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40650:112"/> God; as I have already ſaid §. 22. And altho there is a plain Diſtinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Divine and Humane Nature, yet is he always ſpoken of but as one perſon. Here then I know not better how to expreſs my Sentiments than by ſaying, that in the one and ſingle Perſon of Chriſt, there is a Conjunction of both the Divine and Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently that <hi>Chriſt is</hi> really and truly <hi>both God and Man.</hi> And if the ſame Objection be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Doctrine as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of the Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is very obſcure and difficult to be apprehended; I ſhall alſo return the ſame Anſwer, as I have already
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40650:113"/> done to that in the latter end of §. 23. to which I refer my Reader.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. He who acknowledges Chriſt to be God, to be ſure will allow of his eternal Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to his Divine Nature; And, as to what concerns his Humane Nature; that <hi>he was Conceived by</hi> the Power of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt, Born of the Virgin Mary;</hi> and that, after ſome years ſpent in preaching and doing good, he was, thro the Malice of the Jews, and at their vehement deſire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Governour, to be <hi>crucified;</hi> which was accordingly done, and a Spear thruſt into his Side; That being <hi>dead</hi> he was <hi>buried,</hi> and lay in the Sepulcher unto
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40650:113"/> the <hi>third day;</hi> upon which <hi>he roſe from the dead, and</hi> aſter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times converſing with his Diſciples for the ſpace of Forty days, that he <hi>was</hi> viſibly taken up from them, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Heaven</hi> unto infinite and eternal Glory, <hi>where he is our perpetual Mediatour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour at the Throne of God:</hi> All this, I ſay, is ſo evidently and without Controverſy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Diſciples (whoſe Veracity I have aſſerted, Part 1. §. 19) and recorded in the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whoſe Authority I have proved Part 1. §. 23. &amp;c,) that no reaſonable Man, I think, can now deny, or ſo much as doubt of any part of it: And altho there are one or two
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40650:114"/> paſſages of Scripture, from whence it is inferred, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> before his Reſurrection <hi>did deſcend into Hell,</hi> yet will I not venture, nor do I think it neceſſary, to determine whether by the word <hi>Hell</hi> is meant the ſtate of the dead on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the place of the damned; or (if the latter ſignification be to be choſen) for what end and purpoſe it was that he deſcended thither. Only I conclude certainly, that it was not to ſuffer any thing there; becauſe I do not find the leaſt intimation throughout the Scripture of any ſuffering of Chriſt, which he did or was to endure, beyond the ſhedding of his Blood and yielding up his life upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="39">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40650:114"/>39. What God might have done (had he ſo pleaſed) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other conſideration, but only by virture of his own abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority; if he has rather choſen to do it for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, and in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Obedience which he performed, and thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which he underwent, who ſhall dare to find fault with him, or pretend to be wiſer than he? Now that <hi>it is for the ſake of Chriſt, and of his Obedience and Sufferings, that God vouchſafes to us the Pardon of our Sins, and makes us the offer of everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> is ſo plainly declared in many places of the Holy Scriptures, that nothing can be more. And ſince I find
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40650:115"/> God's ſending of Chriſt to be ſet forth as an inſtance of his Love, not to ſome few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons only, but even to the whole World; and ſince Chriſt is ſaid to have died for all, and to have been a Propitiation for the ſins of the World, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all men who ever were, or are, or ſhall be, might have been, or may be the better for Chriſt and his Sufferings, if through their own default they have not, or ſhall not forfeit that Benefit which was deſigned them. And as it is not diſputed, but that the ancient Patriarchs, who by Faith foreſaw the coming of Chriſt, had a ſhare
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40650:115"/> in that Redemption which he wrought, altho they died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into the World; ſo to me it ſeems to ſtand with a great deal of reaſon, that even thoſe perſons who never heard any thing of Chriſt, may yet for his ſake find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God; becauſe God, who perfectly knows the moſt ſecret Inclinations of all Hearts, may clearly foreſee, that if the knowledge of Chriſt had been propoſed and offered unto them, they would have owned him, and ſubmitted unto his Goſpel; which our Saviour tells us, was the very caſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon;</hi> and for which reaſon he declares that they ſhould receive a milder Doom than <hi>Chorazin</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40650:116"/> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> in the day of Judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 21, 22. And how far this may extend to all ſuch as labour under very ſtrong Prejudices, altho not ſtrictly invincible, I think that God is the only proper Judge.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But however God may think fit to deal with thoſe, who are either ignorant of, or ſtrongly prejudiced againſt the Chriſtian Religion; yet the manner of his proceeding with true Believers is plainly enough declared. All thoſe who receive and own the Chriſtian Faith are not to be looked upon as ſo many ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons; each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſuch and ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; but are always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40650:116"/> in Scripture as Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in one Society or Body, which is called the Church, of which Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the chief or Head; and under an obligation to live in communion and fellowſhip one with another, under thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions which Chriſt has given them; but not, that I can find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, obliged to joyn with, or ſubmit to, any one perſon, as the Vicar of Chriſt and the viſible Head of the Church upon Earth. For if Chriſt had appointed any ſuch perſon as his Deputy upon Earth, he muſt either have declared a matter of ſuch conſequence with great plainneſs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or elſe it would be very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40650:117"/> hard to find fault with any man for being miſtaken in it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Arguments which thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> bring to prove, either that ſuch a Vicar there muſt be, or that St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle was the Man, or that the Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (and not the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch)</hi> is the Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> both in his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and Authority; are all ſo weak and precarious, ſo forced and perplexed, and ſo fully confuted by the Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that nothing in my Opinion but Blindneſs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or worldly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt can prevail with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church, ſtill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon them Now that <hi>Chriſt inſtituted but one Church,</hi> in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40650:117"/> which all true Believers and good livers, are for ever to be compriſed, is very plain. And altho, through the Miſtakes and Perverſeneſs of Man, this Church is rent and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oppoſite, and contending parts, and parties; yet this does not hinder but that according to its true and primitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is, or ought to be one (as a Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by its Laws and Conſtitutions is but one Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, altho there may ariſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and different Intereſts in it) nor ſhall any Man be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as a Member of the Church before God, who is not ready and willing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of his power and knowledge, to maintain
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40650:118"/> the Unity of it, and that upon thoſe very Terms, and none other, which Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as near as poſſibly he can find and apprehend them. Moreover, that all the Laws and Conſtitutions on which Chriſt has founded the Church, and by which he would have it regulated, are exactly agreeable unto the Rules of ſound Morality, and the Will of God, cannot be ſo much as doubted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is truly ſaid, that <hi>the Church is Holy,</hi> altho every particular Member thereof has both his frailties and his ſins; which yet he muſt repent of, and ſo become holy as the Church is holy, or elſe he violates one of the main and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40650:118"/> fundamental Laws, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as it were an Out-law of the Church, and forfeits his part in all the Privileges that belong unto that Society. And whereas, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did enjoy more of the Favour of God, and had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er privileges and advantages, on the ſcore of their being God's choſen and peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than any, or all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World; The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, on the contrary, now looks upon all as equally entitled unto God's Favour (and the advantages thereon depending) who take care duly to qualifie themſelves for it. So that whereas formerly <hi>the Church</hi> (that is, the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40650:119"/> People of God) might have been ſaid to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as being in a manner limited to one Nation or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; now on the contrary, it is <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is to ſay, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as being no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one place or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all People being equally choſen by God in Chriſt, who will receive and love accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. In thoſe ſeveral Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God was pleaſed to make of himſelf after the Fall of Man, unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was ſtill a plain intimation given them, that in the time to come there ſhould an extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ariſe in the World, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40650:119"/> ſhould yet more clearly make known the Will of God to Mankind. But when Chriſt, who was That Perſon, did accordingly come, and ſend his Apoſtles to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel over all the Earth; he neither ſuggeſted to them, nor they unto the World, that any other Revelation was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after to be expected; But always gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that God had in the Goſpel compleated and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that declaration which he intended to make of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his Will, unto Mankind, until the general Judgment and Diſſolution of the World. If therefore the Holy Scripture had given me no manner of aſſurance of the perpetuity of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40650:120"/> the Church; my own Reaſon would have been enough to make me conclude, that God in his Providence will ſo order the matter, as that <hi>the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> being the only known and ordinary means of eternal Salvation, <hi>ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wholly extinguiſhed</hi> while the World laſts, ſo as to ſtand in need of any new Revelation to revive and reſtore it. But that there ſhall always be a certain Company of Men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently conſpicuous to the World, teaching and profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any Errour or Corruption in Doctrine or Worſhip, is what I can no where find promiſed or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, either by Chriſt or any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40650:120"/> of his Apoſtles. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there are ſeveral paſſages in the New Teſtament, which do plainly ſeem to foretell that, in proceſs of time, moſt pernicious Doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices ſhould prevail and take place, even amongſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thoſe who ſhould profeſs themſelves to be Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall but lightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ſtate of Chriſtianity for ſeveral Centuries before the Reformation, with that Draught of it which is left us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the Holy Scriptures, muſt, if he be impartial, I think be fully convinced of the truth of thoſe Predictions.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Whether or no <hi>God</hi> has,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40650:121"/> or does at any time commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate or beſtow any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Grace or Aſſiſtance upon thoſe, who are no viſible Members of the Church, but altogether ſtrangers unto that Revelation which he has made of himſelf, is a queſtion which the virtuous lives and heroick actions of ſome brave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens make it hard poſitively to determine in the negative. But that <hi>he will give</hi> ſo much <hi>Grace and ſtrength to every one who ſhall become a Member of Chriſt's Church,</hi> as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may (if the fault be not their own) ſufficiently qualifie themſelves for eternal Happineſs, by the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe things which he requires on their part to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40650:121"/> done, is what I think no man can doubt of, who does but in general conſider the Mercy and Love which God deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even unto all men, but more eſpecially unto the Church, in ſending our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt Jeſus into the world; altho there were not any particular Promiſes of this nature in the Goſpel: And that this <hi>Grace and ability to do good is in Scripture aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſtry and Influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon the hearts and minds of true Believers,</hi> is plain and generally owned by all Chriſtians. But that this influence of God's Spirit does not work ſo uncontrollably, but that it may be reſiſted, and even wholly rejected and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40650:122"/> loſt, is I think ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, as well from Reaſon and Experience, as form thoſe paſſages of the Holy Scripture wherein we are exhorted not to quench the Spirit, but to walk in, and be led by, the Spirit, and the like; which were apparently needleſs and to no purpoſe, if the operations of the Holy Spirit upon our Hearts were ſo ſtrong as that we could not chuſe but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them. Now <hi>the things which God requires</hi> to be performed <hi>on our part,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to life everlaſting, <hi>are</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and can be no more but to believe thoſe Truths which he has made known, which is called <hi>Faith;</hi> and to obſerve thoſe Precepts which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40650:122"/> he has commanded, which is called <hi>Obedience.</hi> And as I have already ſhewn that theſe things are required from no man beyond the meaſures of poſſibility, Part 1. §. 14. So does the Scripture moſt fully aſſure us, that <hi>God will</hi> in them make a very ſufficient allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the ignorance and frailty, and even for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of our Nature; and will not only be merciful unto our Weakneſſes and ordinary Failings, but will pardon and <hi>forgive even our greateſt and moſt wilful Sins, upon our true and hearty Repentance, which is a part of our Obedience:</hi> And as for the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is ſaid to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unpardonable, I do
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40650:123"/> not think it needful to enquire here into the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it, but ſhall refer my Reader to that excellent Sermon of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> upon that ſubject. But here it is highly neceſſary that we ſhould all take that Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which both Reaſon and the Holy Scripures do give us, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo much upon God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Lenity, as from hence to take occaſion of going on in our Wickedneſs: For Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thus abuſed will certainly turn into the higheſt Wrath, and much increaſe the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Sinner.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. I am inclined to think, that thoſe Arguments which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40650:123"/> are drawn from the nature of the Humane Soul it ſelf are not by themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove that it is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but on the contrary, that the eternal duration of any created Being depends not ſo much upon its own Nature, as upon the Will of God, who created it. But as Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſuggeſts unto us, that there is a Life to come after this, Part 1. §. 13. And that Man was at firſt deſigned by God unto life eternal, (Part 2. §. 29.) ſo does the Holy Scripture moſt clearly aſſure us, that <hi>they who perform what God requires, ſhall be happy to all Eternity; and they who do not ſo, ſhall be miſerable without end.</hi> The reconcilableneſs of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40650:124"/> which with God's Juſtice and Mercy I have accounted for §. 17. But wherein this Happineſs of the righteous ſhall conſiſt, we can but very imperfectly tell; and whether the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked ſhall literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in everlaſting Fire, or whether that expreſſion be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſignifie the greatneſs of the Torment, I think it not neceſſary to determine. But both my own Reaſon and ſome places of Scripture do ſeem ſtrongly to ſuggeſt, that neither the Reward of good men, nor the Puniſhment of the evil, ſhall be equal unto all; but greater or leſs according as they have exceeded one another in the Holineſs or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40650:124"/> Wickedneſs of their Lives.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. That all Men are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is ſufficiently teſtified by out daily Experience: But that the Souls of Men imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their ſeparation from their Bodies are not in a ſtate of Inſenſibility; but are ſtraitway conveyed into a ſtate, either of Joy or Miſery, ſeems very apparent to me from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſire to be diſſolved that he might be with Chriſt; from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Promiſe unto the Thief upon the Croſs; and from the Story or Parable of the Rich man and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> as alſo from ſome other intimations which the Holy Scripture gives us. But ſince <hi>there is,</hi> one day, <hi>to be a general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40650:125"/> of all mankind before the Tribunal of Chriſt,</hi> where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt receive his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for eternal, either Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery (as the Holy Scripture does aſſure us) It ſeems not irrational to judge, that neither the righteous nor the wicked do receive their full and final portion until that Judgment be paſſed upon them. I know not therefore how to condemn thoſe, who anciently took up the Cuſtom of praying for their deceaſed Friends, who had lived holily and died piouſly, that they might find favour and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at the general Judgment, and have their portion of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry augmented; But I can by no means approve of thoſe,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40650:125"/> who upon ſuch pitiful ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions have preſumed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that there is ſuch a place as Purgatory, where the Souls of men are to be purged and ſuffer a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Puniſhment before their admiſſion into Heaven. And altho I look upon their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead to be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, rather than a ſin, yet their taking of Mony for ſo doing, and raiſing ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon that Fund, I look upon to be a moſt ungodly Cheat and Impoſition upon the People.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Altho I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that there is any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decay in the general frame and ſtructure of this World, yet it is certain, that by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40650:126"/> Power of God, who made it, it may, whenever he pleaſes, be deſtroyed and diſſolved; and the Scripture aſſures us, that it ſhall be ſo <hi>at the time of the general Judgment;</hi> at which time alſo <hi>there ſhall be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reſurrection of the Bodies of all thoſe who have died,</hi> and a change of thoſe who ſhall be then alive. But whether all the ſame individual Particles of each mans Body which have been laid down in the earth, ſhall be raiſed and reunited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to their Souls, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a needleſs Enquiry. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays upon this Argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35. does abundantly ſatisfie me; the purport of whoſe words I take to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40650:126"/> God, who being the Author of Nature, has given ſuch a vegetative power to a Grain of Corn, that when it is thrown into the Ground, and there macerated and diſſolved, it ſprings up again, and brings forth a Body ſuitable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to its ſelf; that that ſame God, I ſay, both can and will at the laſt day, from the dead and diſſolved Bodies of Men, raiſe up ſuch Bodies, as ſhall pleaſe himſelf. And as there is a continual and great change of Particles in the Humane Body, between the Birth and the Grave; ſo I ſee not what Abſurdity would follow if we ſhould allow alſo that there is a like change between the Grave and the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="46">
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:40650:127"/>46. And thus I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give a brief and plain account of that part of Chriſtianity which is purely or chiefly doctrinal; which upon the moſt ſtrict ſearch that I have been able to make, I think is exactly agreeable to the tenour and main deſign of the Holy Scriptures, and no way contradictory to the Principles of plain and ſound Reaſon. And if in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points of Speculation, which by ſome are adopted into Religion, I am either wholly ignorant, or perhaps doubtful and undetermined, or, it may be, miſtaken; Yet if to the Belief which I have here profeſſed, I do ſuperadd a virtuous and Chriſtian courſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40650:127"/> of life, I hope there is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Chriſtian, who does not in effect make it a part of his Religion to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, but will allow that I may be ſaved. But wherein this virtuous and Chriſtian life conſiſts, and what are the Duties which the Goſpel obliges us all to perform (whether they are the Duties of pure Morality, as to love God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; or thoſe of poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as to be Baptized, to receive the Holy Communion <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> is to be the ſubject of the Third and laſt part of this ſmall Work; to which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I now proceed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ALL the Commands of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>all the Duties of a Chriſtian, are</hi> reducible to theſe Two; <hi>viz. To abſtain from that which is evil, and to do that which is good, according to his ability.</hi> Thoſe actions I call good, which either are eternally agreeable unto the nature, circumſtances and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual relations of Perſons and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40650:128"/> Things, and therefore for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be approved of by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impartial rational Being (as I have ſaid Part 2. §. 18.) for which we muſt appeal to every mans Reaſon (as we do to his Eyes, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonſtration, to prove that the Sun ſhines) or elſe are expreſly commanded by God, of his own poſitive will and pleaſure (to whom, as being his Creatures, we all owe an intire Obedience) for which we muſt have our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Holy Scriptures of the New Teſtament only; all the poſitive Inſtitutions and Ordinances of the Moſaick Law, which were given by God to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being abrogated, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40650:129"/> of them annulled by our Saviour Chriſt; Altho the moral part of it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Precepts and Rules of eternal good and evil, and wherein the very life and ſoul of that Law conſiſted, be not only abetted and confirmed, but alſo very much improved by him. And ſuch actions as are contrary to good, that is to ſay, either diſagreeable to the nature and circumſtances of Things and Perſons, or elſe poſitively forbidden by God; I call evil. I am indeed of opinion, that in the Holy Scriptures we have not only the poſitive Commands of God, whereby ſome things, which otherwiſe would have been indifferent, are enjoyned
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40650:129"/> or forbidden; but alſo, either in particular, or at leaſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a ſufficient account of all thoſe actions which are eternally good or evil, and therefore to be done or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us; And this deſigned by Almighty God for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and inſtruction of thoſe Men, who have not ability to dive into, and diſcover thoſe things by the ſtrength of their Reaſon. And therefore, in order to deſcribe the whole Duty of a Chriſtian, it might be enough for me to collect the Precepts and Prohibitions which God has given us in his Word, and to vouch no other Authority or reaſon, but his Will for them. But becauſe every mans Duty will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40650:130"/> make the greater impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon his mind, when he is ſatisfied, as to the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of it, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its obligation; I ſhall endeavour, as I proceed, firſt to infer as much of our Duty as I can, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and circumſtances of Things and Perſons; and then to ſuperadd, where there is occaſion, what God has poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ordained and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to any point; And this with the ſame conciſeneſs that I have obſerved in my Second Part, neither enlarging upon thoſe Arguments, nor recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Texts of Scripture, which I ſuppoſe my Reader to be able to call to mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt hint of them,</p>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40650:130"/>2. To begin then: Since <hi>God</hi> is the moſt perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being in Himſelf; and ſo loving and beneficent to Us, It follows, that <hi>we ought to love him in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that poſſibly we can;</hi> And true and compleat Love, as it is an act of one perſon exerted towards another, as its object, conſiſts in an unſeigned deſire, Firſt, of always doing what may be truly grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; and Secondly, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and being with him as much as may be. The more ardent and zealous we are in our love to God, the better undoubtedly it is; And we ſhould ſtrive to engage our Affections, as well as our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40650:131"/> and our Will, unto him from whom we have received all things: But yet this Love is not to be meaſured, or judged of, by the earneſtneſs of thoſe ſuddain motions, which ſometimes may ariſe within us, upon the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God's Excellency and Goodneſs; becauſe to be thus <hi>Paſſionately</hi> affected is not wholly in our Power; and ſomtimes leaſt ſo, when we moſt earneſtly deſire it. But the true and certain way of judging whether we love God, or not, is by examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ſtedfaſt in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in our Endeavours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to obey him, and keep all his Commandments;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40650:131"/> which is the only way to pleaſe, and conſequently to enjoy and for ever be with him: And where the Love of God is thus firmly rooted in the <hi>Will,</hi> and brings forth plenty of Fruit in the life and actions, it is certainly never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs acceptable to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it does not ſo paſſionately move our Affections as we could wiſh or deſire: And as all the Duties which we owe unto Almighty God, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from, and do depend upon that, of loving of him; or rather indeed are contained in it, ſo is it very evident, that they are all to be judged of by the ſame forementioned Rule; that is to ſay, not ſo much by the ſtrength of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40650:132"/> Impulſe upon the Mind (which is a thing not under our Command) as by the ſteady agreeableneſs of our Will and Actions, unto all ſuch Principles, as are right and good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Since God is the moſt excellent and perfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the moſt worthy, of all Beings, that are, or can be; from hence it will follow, that <hi>we ought to honour him with the greateſt Honour that may be.</hi> Now to honour any perſon is, in other words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to eſteem, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to ſhew our Reſpect to him. Our inward Eſteem of God conſiſts in a due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Being and Attributes; and our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40650:132"/> Reſpect to him, is to be ſhewn, as well by abſtaining from all actions which may ſavour of any Neglect or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence towards him, as by performing all ſuch as may appear to be ſuitable, both to his own Excellency and our Dependence upon him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Since God is preſent in all places, and knows all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt ſecret things; and therefore cannot poſſibly be deceived, or impoſed on; <hi>We ſhould,</hi> on this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>be very watchful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, upon all occaſions, how we behave our ſelves in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:</hi> And, methinks, it is a moſt ſhameful and deplorable thing, that Men commonly ſcruple, not to do thoſe things
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40650:133"/> in the ſight of God, which they would be afraid, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed it ſhould be known, or even ſuſpected, of them, by Men like themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Since God is moſt true; from hence it will follow, that <hi>we ought to believe what ſoever he ſays or makes known,</hi> how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable ſoever otherwiſe it might ſeem to us. But the true eſtimate of ſuch belief is not to be made by the clearneſs and ſtrength of our ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſent unto thoſe Truths, which he has propoſed to our Underſtanding (for to receive a Truth without any Doubts or Scruples, which ſometimes do unaccountably force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon us, even in the cleareſt caſes, is not always in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40650:133"/> our power) But rather by the conſtant ſuitableneſs of ourlives unto the profeſſion of ſuch Doctrines as we receive and own. And he who has but a weak Faith, and yet leads a good life, altho he is not qualified for doubtful Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is nevertheleſs a true Believer; becauſe his Belief anſwers the main end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel; which I have ſhewn to be Virtue and Morality, Part 1. §. 42. Nor can there (for example) be a better Evidence, that a man does really and ſufficiently Believe the Truth of a life to come, than when he is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and diligent in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it; whatever Doubts or Scruples he may have, in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40650:134"/> point of Speculation, about it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Since God's Power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and his Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable; it follows, that <hi>we ought to fear him</hi> (and ſo much the more, becauſe of our natural propenſity to ſin) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has it always in his Power to make us miſerable here, and eternally ſo hereafter. But he cannot be ſaid to fear God moſt (that is, moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) who is poſſeſſed with the greateſt dread and terrour at the thoughts of his Wrath or Judgments; for then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who tremble, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wretches, who deſpair of God's Mercy, would be the beſt performers of this Duty: But he is the trueſt Fearer of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40650:134"/> God, who always takes the greateſt care not to offend him; the Fear of him being never originally deſigned to torment and diſquiet our Minds, but only to be ſuch a Check upon us, as to keep us in due Awe and Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Since every ſin is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, both againſt a gracious and a powerful God, and of every dangerous conſequence to the perſon who commits it; And ſince nothing can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be concealed from God, it follows, that <hi>we ought to be</hi> deeply concerned, and <hi>truly ſorrowful for every ſin which we commit, and</hi> by no means to palliate or frame Excuſes for them, but <hi>freely to own and confeſs them to him.</hi> But the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40650:135"/> truth of this Sorrow is not to be meaſured by the Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateneſs of it, or the Tears which it produces (which, tho ſometimes good ſigns, yet, too often produce but little effect) but by the hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of life that follows: And he only can be ſaid, to any purpoſe, either to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his ſins, or to confeſs them to God; who is careful for the time to come to forſake them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Since God is Almighty, he is certainly able; and ſince he loves us, he cannot but be willing, to do every thing that is beſt and fitteſt for us, if we, by our own faults, do not provoke him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40650:135"/> that, as long as we ſerve him faithfully, <hi>we ought, in all our wants and exigencies, to truſt and relie upon him.</hi> And if he does not relieve or help us in ſuch a manner as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; <hi>we ought to bear whatever Afflictions we lie under, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contentedly;</hi> as well knowing, that God takes no delight in grieving us; but only corrects and keeps us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in order to our eternal good. And to demonſtrate our Truſt in God, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his chaſtiſing hand; we muſt never attempt, by any unlawful means, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any of our Wants, or free our ſelves from any, even the moſt grievous preſſures: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, at the ſame time, honeſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40650:136"/> labour and induſtry (yet ſtill with ſubmiſſion to God's Will) for the compaſſing of any thing which is lawlful and good, is not only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but commended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But ſince God is a free Agent, and ſince all the good which we have, or are capable of, comes from him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends altogether on his Power and over-ruling Providence; <hi>we ought to pray to him for whatſoever we ſtand in need of;</hi> and that he would bleſs all our honeſt Labours with ſucceſs. But becauſe, often, if we had the very things which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, they would, at the laſt, tend to our hurt; and becauſe he knows what is fit for us,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40650:136"/> much better than we our ſelves; therefore <hi>we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to pray, that his Will ſhould ever take place rather than our own.</hi> And ſince we can have no reaſon to doubt of his Love, we ought to aſſure our ſelves, that we ſhall receive either the very things we pray for, or elſe that which is altogether as good for us, if our ſins ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it not.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And the very ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which prompt us to make our Prayers to God in all our wants, do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate, that <hi>we ought to return Thanks unto him for all the Bleſſings which we have received:</hi> Amongſt which thoſe Afflictions which have at any time reclaimed us from ſin,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40650:137"/> and brought us to a ſenſe of our Duty, ought, I think, to be placed in the chiefeſt rank: And the only Demonſtration of a truly thankful Heart to God, is the making a pious and honeſt uſe, to his Glory, of all thoſe Bleſſings which we daily receive from him: Nor can there be any thing more abſurd, than for a man to pretend to give God Thanks with his Lips, who does not alſo do it, more to the purpoſe, in his Life.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. As God's Juſtice and Veracity are a reaſon beyond exception, why <hi>we ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Anxiety depend on all his Promiſes;</hi> ſo the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which he has made us, being that of everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40650:137"/> for our more effectual attaining unto which, he has ſent his Son our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus to ſuffer for us; <hi>It is</hi> therefore accordingly <hi>our Duty to hope for eternal Salvation;</hi> that is to ſay, to expect the performance of what God has promiſed, and the enjoyment of what Chriſt has purchaſed for us. But this hope is to be ſhewn not by the ſtrength of our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we ſhall be ſaved (in which it is very poſſible that a man may deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) but by our conſtant care in duly performing what God requires, on our parts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation: For he only who is diligent in doing the work, does, with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40650:138"/> expect, or hope for the promiſed Reward.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. As <hi>we are obliged</hi> to pray unto God for all that we want, and to hope for eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him; ſo the Holy Scripture directs us, <hi>to ground all our hopes of Happineſs upon the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and to offer up all our Prayers in his Name,</hi> as hoping only for his ſake to be accepted, who is repreſented as our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediatour and Interceſſour with God. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offers to joyn the Merits, Mediation or Interceſſion of any Saint, together with Chriſt Jeſus, either to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his hopes of Salvation, or to make his Devotions more ſurely to be accepted by God;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40650:138"/> as he ſeems to diſtruſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt, as if, alone, it were imperfect and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; ſo he acts not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Warrant from, but even contrary to the plain tenour of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That it is abſurd to attempt, and impoſſible to make, any bodily or viſible Picture or Image to repreſent God, who is both incorporeal and inviſible, is moſt evident beyond doubt or denyal: And when any ſuch Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made with that deſign, and expoſed to the view of the People, the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them, muſt needs be to beget wrong Notions of God in the Minds at leaſt of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40650:139"/> the more ignorant ſort: For ſuch as any thing is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, ſuch they will be apt to conceive it in all points to be. My Reaſon therefore alone would ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conclude, that <hi>it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to make any ſort of Picture or Image to repreſent God,</hi> altho he had not ſo poſitively for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it in the Holy Scripture; nor ſo expresſly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a jealous God in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. In all Caſes where one man may deceive another to his great damage; it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that he, who apprehends ſuch danger, ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon another man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt has good ſecurity given him of his Truth and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40650:139"/> Fidelity. Now many times the beſt, or indeed the only, ſecurity which can be given in ſuch caſes, is a ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Almighty God (who is the Searcher of all Hearts, and the Puniſher of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs) as expecting and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering one's ſelf to his Wrath and Vengeance, in caſe he prevaricates in what he aſſerts or promiſes: And this is what we call by the Name of an Oath. And ſince he who takes an Oath (I mean with due ſeriouſneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) does therein make an evident acknowledgment of ſome of the principal Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; <hi>viz.</hi> his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Juſtice, Truth, and Power; it follows that <hi>an
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40650:140"/> Oath, duly taken,</hi> is an act of Honour and Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>is not,</hi> in its ſelf, <hi>unlawful or evil:</hi> But <hi>if an Oath be taken raſbly, or unadviſedly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, or in trivial caſes; it is</hi> a leſſening and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of the Divine Majeſty (which ought always to be treated with the profoundeſt Reverence) and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ſinful</hi> and unlawful. And this is all that I can conceive to be forbidden by our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. Nor can I apprehend that, that place contains an univerſal prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſwearing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: For, beſides that the very Context in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe does moſt evidently
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40650:140"/> limit the diſcourſe to ſuch Oaths as are purely voluntary, and therefore altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; There is neither Reaſon nor Precedent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any one to believe that our Saviour would univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid any thing which has nothing of Evil or Malignity in its nature: And ſome even of the beſt of Men, not only before, but ſince the coming of Chriſt, and even the Bleſſed Angels themſelves, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in Scripture, have ſworn upon ſome occaſions with great ſolemnity. Nor do the Holy Scriptures, in other places, where mention is made of the taking of an Oath, ſpeak of it as a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or forbidden, or any way
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40650:141"/> univerſally evil in its ſelf, but altogether the contrary: Nor did our Bleſſed Saviour, that we can find, deſign to deprive Princes or Magiſtrates of any part of that lawful Power which they had over their Subjects before his coming; who, every where, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a Right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting an Oath from Them, when it ſhould be neceſſary, either for the peace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Common-wealth, or for the ending of Differences between private parties. And as for that paſſage of St. <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. which is by ſome urged againſt ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any caſe whatſoever; It, being no more but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation of our Saviours
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40650:141"/> words which were juſt now mentioned, needs no other Anſwer than what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given. But ſince the very nature and deſign of an Oath is to invoke God, that thereby a Man may give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to another of his truth and fidelity; it follows, that <hi>to affirm any thing upon Oath, beyond what the Man, who ſwears, knows to be true; or not to perform what he has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath promiſed, is a ſin.</hi> And ſince he who impoſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another by doubtful and equivocal words, does as much deceive him, as he who ſpeaks a down-right Falſity; from hence it will follow, that ſuch <hi>a deceitful Oath is</hi> altogether as contrary to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40650:142"/> nature and deſign of an Oath, and conſequently as <hi>unlawful</hi> as a falſe one. But altho <hi>an Oath lays an obligation upon a Man to do whatever he has ſworn,</hi> yet <hi>if a Man ſwears to do any thing which is a ſin,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome former Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under which he indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably lyes to God or Man, <hi>he can not in this caſe be obliged to keep his Oath,</hi> but is bound to repent of it. For, beſides that it is not reaſonable, that any mans own act ſhould free him from any Obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he lyes to another; it is plain, that an Oath can neither alter the nature of a ſin, nor make it lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. And ſince the deſign of an Oath in its own nature
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40650:142"/> is to oblige him to perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that takes it; and ſince the Name of God ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unneceſſarily to be invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it follows, that <hi>where a Man ought not to keep an Oath, he ought, not on any account to take it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. According to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of different places, there have divers Ceremonies and Forms of words been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the taking of an Oath; ſome of them ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Reaſon, and others taken up through miſtake in imitation. Thus, probably, whereas it may have been a Cuſtom in ſome places in an Oath to invoke the Vengeance of God upon ones <hi>head;</hi> from hence, likely, might ariſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40650:143"/> that Form of ſwearing by the Head; and, in imitation thereof, by the Hand, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Body. And whereas it was uſual to take ſolemn Oaths, in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, in the Temple, or at the Altar, and, with us at this time, laying the Hand upon the Holy Scriptures; from hence might ariſe the Forms of ſwearing by the Temple, the Altar, the Bible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here it muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the nature of an Oath being for aſſurance, and conſiſting therefore altogether in the intention of the parties, <hi>viz.</hi> as well of him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, as of him who gives it; <hi>He may be ſaid really and truly to ſnear,</hi> not only who
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40650:143"/> makes uſe of ſuch a Form and Ceremony as is accuſtomed or preſcribed in any certain place, but he <hi>who any ways ſignifies to another an intention to oblige himſelf under the penalty of God's Wrath and Vengeance:</hi> And for the ſame reaſon <hi>the joynt intention of both parties,</hi> as it appears fairly to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified (without any place for Fraud or Colluſion) <hi>muſt needs be the true meaſure of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. When a Man promiſes a thing, and obliges himſelf thereto, not to any other Man, but only to God alone; this is what is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Vow;</hi> and, <hi>comes</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly <hi>under the ſame Rules with a Promiſory Oath</hi> (as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40650:144"/> appear to whoſoever reads the two foregoing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) that I need not again particularly repear them. But it is a very neceſſary caution to be obſerved in all Oaths, and more eſpecially to be taken care of in Vows; that <hi>a Man ſhould never voluntarily oblige himſelf to any thing but what he is well aſſured is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his power to perform;</hi> I mean with the help of that common Aſiſtance and Grace which God has promiſed to all that ſeek it. For if a Man goes beyond this, and tyes ſuch Burdens upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he is not ſufficiently ſure of ſtrength to bear; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the preſumption of the thing, it muſt needs involve
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40650:144"/> his Conſcience in many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Perplexities.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Since there is no other Being whatſoever, which for Power, Goodneſs, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Nature can any way be equalled to, or compared with, Almighty God; from hence it will follow, that all <hi>theſe foregoing Duties, which we owe unto God</hi> on the account and ſuppoſition of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of his Nature and Attributes, <hi>are not any of them to be paid unto any Thing or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſides himſelf.</hi> For that would be in effect to ſet up ſomewhat elſe as a God, or in the place of God, unto our ſelves. Let them then who ſeem either to love, or fear, or truſt in, any Thing or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40650:145"/> Perſon as much or more than God; and who offer up their Prayers and Devotions unto any Saints or Angels; which ſeems to ſuppoſe their Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and that they know the Secrets of Mens Hearts; and to argue ſome diſtruſt of God's Goodneſs and Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hear us; Let them, I ſay, and ſuch like perſons, conſider well with themſelves, how, they can anſwer theſe things to God, who is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God. But ſince <hi>every Man,</hi> who is ſincere in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>muſt neceſſarily ſuit his Worſhip and Duty to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apprehenſions which he has of the Deity;</hi> He who is convinced of the diſtinction
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40650:145"/> of Perſons in the Unity of the God head (of which I have endeavoured to give my Thoughts Part 2. §. 22.) <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> I think, <hi>but make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, the joynt Objects of his Service and Devotion.</hi> And why it ſhould not be both lawful and proper to invoke the Son and Holy Ghoſt, together with the Father, in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as to be Baptized, and to Bleſs, in their Names, together with him (which are both I think acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip) I confeſs I can ſee no ſound reaſon that can be given. But if any man ſhall tell me, that, in the Worſhip of God, he dares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther than the Holy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40650:146"/> Scriptures will expresſly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and therefore that he can not invoke the Holy Ghoſt in his Prayers, becauſe he there finds neither Precept for, nor Example of it (Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Man, but leaving every Man to ſtand or fall to his own Maſter) for my ſelf I anſwer, that ſince God has made us reaſonable Creatures, I can not but think that a clear, and rational Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from Scripture is as good a Warrant for any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious action, and lays as great an Obligation upon him that is convinced of it, as the moſt expreſs Text: And if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality and Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt be admitted (as I here ſuppoſe) to me, no
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40650:146"/> Conſequence ſeems to be clearer than that he is to be invoked and worſhiped, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Since the end to which God deſigns all Men, is etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Happineſs in another life; Part 2. §. 29. To a capacity for which we are again, after our Fall, reſtored by Jeſus Chriſt, Part 2. §. 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It follows, that <hi>we ought not to do any thing whereby we may miſs of this end, or be diverted from the proſecution of it; But on the contrary, that the whole courſe of our actions and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould ever be bent on the purſuit of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. No Man will ever be diligent in the purſuit of any
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40650:147"/> thing of which he ſeldom thinks, and rarely conſiders the benefit of obtaining, and the evil of miſſing it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are obliged to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in our endeavours after eternal Happineſs; <hi>we ought to make the Joys of Heaven and the Torments of Hell the ſubject of our frequent Thoughts and Meditations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. He who places his Happineſs, or any part of it, upon a wrong Object, will never be ſo diligent as he ought in the purſuit of that true Happineſs, to which he is deſigned by God; becauſe the ſtream of his Thoughts and Endeavours muſt needs, in the whole, or in part, be diverted, according as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40650:147"/> his Happineſs to lie another way. Now that there is nothing in this World (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a good Conſcience, and the hope of eternal Life, which, tho they may be had <hi>in</hi> this World, yet are not <hi>of</hi> the World) that can any way make up a part of our real Happineſs, is abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from the vanity, uncertainty and ſhortneſs of all worldly Joys. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who places any part of his Happineſs upon any thing belonging to this World, moſt certainly, places it upon a wrong Object. But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man propoſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the ultimate End of any of his actions, it is certain that, therein he places ſome
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40650:148"/> part, at leaſt, of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For that which is the ultimate End of any action of a Man, muſt be propoſed as the final ſatisfaction of ſome of his Deſires (for as far as any one's Deſire extends, ſo far off muſt be the End he aims at) and no Deſire of any Man can ever be finally ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, till it meets with that wherein he ſuppoſes his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs (in whole or in part) to conſiſt. From hence then it will follow, that altho there are ſome Pleaſures and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions in this World, which may innocently be enjoyed, yet <hi>No man ought to propoſe any worldly enjoyment as the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End and Deſign of any of his Actions.</hi> For this would
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40650:148"/> be a placing his Happineſs, or ſome part of it, upon a wrong Object, and thereby a hinderance of his purſuit of the true Happineſs for which God deſigns him. To illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, which otherwiſe may ſeem obſcure, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or two. A Man may lawfully, without doubt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Meat he eats (for to what other end did God give us the Senſe of Taſting) but the reaſon of his eating, at all times, ought to be to preſerve his Life and Health, that he may be the better able to do all thoſe things which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from him in order to his Salvation; this being the End for which God deſigns him, and which he therefore
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40650:149"/> ought always to purſue. But he who in eating deſigns no more than to gratifie his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetite, or to pamper his Body that he may have the greater enjoyment of the reſt of the Pleaſures of this World; acts below, or rather contrary to, the End he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for; and may juſtly be compared to the Beaſts that periſh. Thus alſo a Man may innocently be pleaſed to have the Garment he wears, decent and comely, becauſe the Eye is naturally gratified with the beauty of any Object: But if a Man wears Cloths which are more fine and coſtly than ſome others, his reaſon ought to be that he may not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humour of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40650:149"/> world) be contemned for the Meaneſs or Sordidneſs of his Apparel; but endeavour, by all fair ways, to preſerve ſuch a Reſpect among Men (who are very apt to judge by the outward appearance) as may enable him to do the more good in the world: But he who cloths himſelf like the Lillies of the Field, or <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory, only that he may admire himſelf, or be taken notice of by others, for his remarkable Finery, is a vain perſon, and acts as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Crow in the Fable, who clad himſelf in the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks Feathers. And what I have here ſaid concerning Food and Raiment, may alſo be applyed to Riches and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40650:150"/> Honour, and to all Pleaſures, which are not abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; and to every thing which Men aim at, or value in this World; which they may lawfully ſeek after and take delight in, as far as they may be Inſtruments of doing Good, or are conſiſtent with their Chriſtian Duty; but they muſt not place their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or any part of it, in them; for that would make them forgetful of Heaven, and neceſſarily involve them in the ſins of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. As we are obliged to do whatſoever God commands, and patiently to ſuffer whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he, in his Providence,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40650:150"/> ſhall think fit to lay or inflict upon us; ſo, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are we certainly bound to continue in this both doing and patiently ſuffering, until ſuch time as he ſhall be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of his own Will, to free and diſmiſs us from it. From whence, it follows, that <hi>no man ought,</hi> upon any account, <hi>to lay violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or voluntarily contribute to the ſhortning of his own Life,</hi> becauſe he knows not but that God might be willing to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him yet farther, with Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings or other tryals, to his Glory, and the good of his own Soul. Nor ought any Servant, without leave or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to withdraw himſelf from the Service of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40650:151"/> And the ſame reaſon which forbids us to deſtroy our Lives, ſhould alſo keep us from putting them to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or unneceſſary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. He who in Duty is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to any thing, lies alſo, of nedeſſity, under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to qualifie himſelf as well as he can, and to ſeek after, and make uſe of all ſuch Means and Inſtruments as are neceſſary for the better exceuting and compaſſing that ſame thing to which he is ſo obliged. Since then <hi>Health of Body, Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and a competency of Riches, Power and Authority,</hi> are neceſſary Qualifications and Inſtruments for the better
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40650:151"/> performance of many of thoſe Duties, to which we ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by God's Law; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that theſe <hi>are things which every man, according to his capacity, ought to ſeek and endeavour after.</hi> But we muſt not ſtrive nor ſeek for any of theſe things by Ways or Means that are unlawful and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for that would be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, to deſtroy and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the very End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for which alone they are to be ſought and deſired: namely Virtue, Piety and the Service of God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. On the other ſide; Whatſoever is an impediment or obſtacle to the performance of any neceſſary Duty, we are bound, as far as we are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40650:152"/> able, to ſuppreſs or remove it out of the way. Now our Reaſon being that which firſt leads us to the Knowledg of Religion, and always enables us rightly to underſtand and judge of our Duty; And ſince all violent Paſſions, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eager Affections, do diſturb our Reaſon, and very much hinder the free uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it; It follows, that <hi>we ought always ſo to govern our Paſſions and reſtrain all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> as that they may be wholly ſubſervient to, and never over-rule or miſ-lead, our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Since God is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and therefore alſo the abſolute Lord of all things; every thing certainly ought
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40650:152"/> by us to be always put and applyed to that very ſame end and uſe (and no other) for which it was intended by him, as far as we have any intimation of his deſign, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Reaſon or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that thoſe Creatures which God has given us, to feed, ſuſtain and keep us in health, that we may be the better able to do our Duty, and labour in our ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ought not at any time (much leſs ordinarily) to be uſed to Exceſs, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our Health, or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Reaſon, or any way hinder us in the performance of any Duty: And that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Generation, which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40650:153"/> God has endowed us with, in order to the propagation of Mankind, ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed for the ſake of filthy ſenſual Pleaſure. Nor ought that plenty of Creatures, which God has beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for the ſervice of all Men, without exception, to be engroſſed into the hands of any certain Men, ſo as that others ſhould want the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life, whilſt they abound in Superfluity. By which it appears, that <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenneſs, Luſt and Covetouſneſs are ſins,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be avoided; and therefore, on the contrary, that <hi>Temperance, Chaſtity, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Liberality are Duties,</hi> and always to be practiſed.</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:40650:153"/>25. Experience aſſures us, that the Spirit of Man is of an active nature; and, rather than be altogether idle, will be apt to employ its ſelf in that which is evil. Nor does a man ever lie more open to Temptation than when he has nothing at all to do. <hi>He</hi> therefore <hi>that would keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf innocent, muſt be careful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to avoid Idleneſs.</hi> For beſides that Idleneſs would prove a Snare to us; It is a ſhame and a ſin. When there is ſo much of God's work to be done in the world (for the promoting of his Glory and the Publick good of Mankind) that any man, who pretends to be his Servant, ſhould ſtand ſtill, and not put his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40650:154"/> helping hand to the carrying of it on. But as we cannot ſay that a Man is idle, when he lies down to ſleep; that, being thereby refreſhed, he may be the better able again to labour; ſo muſt we by no means paſs that Cenſure on him, who now and then ſpends ſome ſmall portion of his Time in ſome pleaſant and innocent Recreation; that, having his Thoughts hereby a little relaxed and diverted, he may be the fitter to return to Buſineſs of moment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But as for thoſe perſons, whoſe whole life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is nothing elſe but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; and who ſcarce ever ſet themſelves to any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby either God is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40650:154"/> glorified, or others benefited; what can they expect but the ſame Sentence which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon the idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 26. And if, to be altogether idle and unemployed is not to be excuſed or juſtified; how much more are they to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned who are ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in ſuch things as are evil and ſcandalous?</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Since the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Duty ariſes chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a true judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the circumſtances and qualifications of Things and Perſons, it follows, that <hi>every Man ſhould endeavour,</hi> as far as he is able, <hi>to inform himſelf rightly,</hi> and to frame true Notions, in all points, <hi>of and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40650:155"/> concerning God, Himſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men;</hi> to whom there are Duties owing; <hi>and alſo of all thoſe things which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of any of</hi> thoſe <hi>Duties,</hi> and in the true management whereof, ſuch Duties do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. For if he be miſtaken in his Judgment concerning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity take wrong Meaſures in his actions. Thus, for Example, if a Man ſhould not believe God to be eternal, moſt good, wiſe and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would not be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to love, honour and fear him in that degree that he ought to do; And if we do not always remember ourſelves to be frail Creatures, ſubject to Paſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40650:155"/> of ſhort continuance in this World, and that, whatever Excellency we may ſeem to have, we derive it wholly from God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and not from our ſelves; we ſhall never be able ſo effectually as we ought, to govern our Paſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain our Affections from the things of this World, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that End for which God has deſigned us. And if we do not conſider that other Men (whatever accidental Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences there may be between us) are equal to us in nature, that their Souls are as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in God's ſight as ours, that Chriſt died for them, as much as for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall not be inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40650:156"/> our ſelves to them with that Juſtice, Charity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility which do evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be our Duty. And, laſtly, if we do not frame a true Notion of the Vanity of the things of this World, and the Excellency of the Joys of Heaven; we ſhall never be able to prefer the later before the former, in ſuch a meaſure as we ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Altho the chief Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind is reſerved by God to be enjoyed in another life, by thoſe who heartily ſtrive for it whilſt they are in this; yet can I find no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed us all, or any of us, to be abſolutely miſerable whilſt we remain in this World. On
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40650:156"/> the contrary, ſince God has originally a love for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, Part 2. §. 16. I cannot but conclude, that he always (even in this life) deſigns at leaſt ſome ſhare or beginning of Happineſs for every Man; and never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, or ſuffers any Man to be afflicted, but only in order to his greater Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; until ſuch time as he thinks it proper to pour out his Vengeance and final De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon ſuch as have by their Wickedneſs altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſeited his Love and Favour. Since then God ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally deſigns ſome meaſure or commencement of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all Men, even in this life, as well as eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40650:157"/> hereafter; it follows, that we (who ought as much as we can to be ſubſervient to all God's Deſigns) ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as much as in us lies, to promote the Happineſs of every Man, both in relation to this World, and of that which is to come. Or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms, that <hi>every Man ſhould endeavour to do as much good to all others as he can, and to hurt no man whatſoever, if he can avoid it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. But if every Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept ſingly by himſelf, without any Society or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with others; it would be impoſſible to do any good one to another: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that it is the Will of God that <hi>Mankind
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40650:157"/> ſhould live each with other in a ſtate of Society.</hi> And to make us all the more ſenſible of the neceſſity and obligation that lies upon us thus to live with, and do good to others, God has ſo ordered the ſtate and condition of all Mankind, that it is not poſſible for any Man long to ſubſiſt, much leſs to enjoy any ſort of Comfort or ſatiſfaction in this Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the good will and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of others; which he has no reaſon to expect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be ready upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to retaliate what he himſelf ſo continually ſtands in need of. And ſince God's original Love to Mankind is not confined to ſome certain perſons, but univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40650:158"/> to all; I muſt needs conclude, that he deſigns not only the Comfort and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome particulars; but univerſally of all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And ſince the more univerſal the Society between Men is, the more univerſal the Happineſs which thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults will be; it will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that it is God's Will that every Man ſhould behave himſelf after a ſociable and friendly manner, to every other Man, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſince there is no Man in the World, however weak and poor, or at never ſo great a diſtance from me, but it is poſſible that things may fall out ſo as that, one time or other, I may, in my
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40650:158"/> Diſtreſs, ſtand in need of his Help and Friendſhip, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells me, that it is my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as well as Duty, as much as I am able, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to oblige every Man who comes in my way, by doing Offices of Civility and Kindneſs to him, as occaſion offers.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That God has given to Mankind in general the free Liberty to make uſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſuſtenance, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does aſſure me; becauſe without ſome of them we could not preſerve our ſelves in being; and if we had not liberty to deſtroy others of them for our uſe, they would
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40650:159"/> in time ſo over-ſpread the Face of the Earth, as that we could not have any ſafe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Habitation upon it. But if all theſe Creatures were always to remain in common, ſo that no Man ſhould have a Right to take poſſeſſion of any part of them to his own prticular uſe and diſpoſal, and to exclude others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; the Conſequence muſt needs be perpetual Diſcord and Confuſion. For when I had prepared Food to ſuſtain my Hunger, or Rayment to defend me from the Cold; if every other Man ſhould have ſtill as good a Right thereto as I, any one might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it away from me; and if my Right were as good as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40650:159"/> any others, I might alſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Defend my Poſſeſſion; from which ſtate of things Contention and Strife muſt eternally and unavoidably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. I therefore conclude, that there muſt be ſome Laws of Property and Right; and that <hi>every man muſt yield to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that which is their own,</hi> or elſe there can be no ſuch thing as Society and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence preſerved and kept up amongſt Mankind. Now in order to diſcover theſe ſame Laws of Right and Property, whereby every man is to know what is truly his own, I lay down this general Rule, as a thing moſt reaſonable, That, Whereas originally eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans Right and Title to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40650:160"/> every thing may be eſteemed equal (God having given us all the Creatures in common, and not, by any act of his, divided to each Man his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Property) If there be any apparent, or but prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ground why ſuch or ſuch a particular thing ſhould be the Property of one Man rather than of another, that ought ſo to determine the matter as to oblige all other Men quietly to yield and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to enjoy and uſe that ſame thing, whatever it be, as his own. For where the Ballance ſtands exactly even, a ſmall matter is enough to turn the Scale to one ſide. Now in theſe following Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there ſeems to be great
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40650:160"/> Reaſon for determining a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in a thing to particular perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. When a Man is the firſt that takes actual Poſſeſſion of a thing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it to his own uſe. For ſuch a Poſſeſſion is an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his general Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what any other Man, who never was in Poſſeſſion, can pretend. And why ſhould I part with my Poſſeſſion to any other, or he demand it from me, except he were able to make out a better Title than I to the thing in diſpute? 2. When a Man takes Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a thing, which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rejected and deſerted by him, who laſt had the Right to, and Poſſeſſion of it. For his Caſe ſeems to be much
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40650:161"/> the ſame with his who firſt takes Poſſeſſion of a thing, 3. When a thing is given, or in Exchange made over, to another by him who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a juſt Right thereto: for it is highly reaſonable, that every Man ſhould have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſpoſe of his own, 4. When a Company of People do by an Agreement make a Partition of what was before in Common amongſt them all, it is reaſonable that every Man ſhould acquieſce in that ſhare which upon ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, ſhall fall to his Lot. 5. When a Man takes care and pains to produce and rear any thing for his own uſe or profit, it is reaſonable that he (and not another Man againſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40650:161"/> his Conſent) ſhould enjoy the benefit, of his own Labour. And laſtly, where a Society of People do ſubmit their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties unto a legiſlative Power which is erected amongſt them, it is reaſonable that herein they ſhould always be concluded and determined by the Laws of that Community, of which they are Members. And if there be any other Rules for determining the Rights of Men to particular things, it is moſt evident, that due care muſt be taken to keep and obſerve them, or elſe farewel all Order and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Where Fidelity is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Society cannot be truly kept and preſerved. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40650:162"/> conclude, that <hi>every man is obliged faithfully to perform whatever he Promiſes;</hi> except the perſon to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, do freely acquit and diſcharge him from it. But if a Man promiſes to do a thing which is ſinful, he ought not to keep ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as that; as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn in the Caſe of an Oath.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And the ſame Reaſons which oblige us to hurt no Man, to yield to every Man his Right, and to keep our Promiſes, do plainly ſhew, that <hi>he who wrong fully hurts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or deprives him of his Right, or breaks his Promiſe made to him, ought, as far as he is able, to make full Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40650:162"/> and Satisfaction to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he has thus injured.</hi> For he that makes a Breach in humane Society, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obliged, as far as he can, to repair it.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Where a Propoſition is literally falſe, and yet ſpoken with no manner of intention to deceive another, it is not to be called a Lye: But he who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts any thing for a Truth, with an intent to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe it, which is, or for ought he knows may be, falſe, he only is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Lyar. Now ſome have doubted whether the ſin of a Lye conſiſts in the bare Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, or only in the Injuſtice of it; and from thence have been inclined to believe, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40650:163"/> ſuch a Lye as does no hurt to any one, not draws any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil conſequence after it, is not to be looked on as a ſin; and ſo much the leſs, if it be told with a real deſign only to do Good, or prevent Miſchief. The Niceties of this Controverſy I leave to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by others. But ſince humane Society cannot be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held without, in many caſes, a dependence upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Veracity, I may ſurely venture thus far to conolude; <hi>viz.</hi> That, not only ſuch a Lye as tends to the damage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but alſo <hi>ſuch a Lye,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwiſe innocent, <hi>as gives occaſion to render a Mans Truth ſuſpected in other caſes, is</hi> to be reputed <hi>unlawful,</hi> if for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40650:163"/> no other Reaſon, yet at leaſt fore this, becauſe it is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to humane Society. <hi>And the</hi> ſame <hi>Reaſon will hold as ſtrongly againſt all mental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and equivocal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions:</hi> For what is humane Society at any time the better for the literal Truth of what a Man ſays, if others who are therein concerned, do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his true meaning by the words which he ſpeaks to them?</p>
                  <p n="33">33. It is highly reaſonable that every Man ſhould have ſuch an Eſteem and Reſpect ſhewed him, as may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his Virtues and good Qualities: And as it is proper enough for a Man, by lawful ways, to aſſert his own
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40650:164"/> Reputation whenever it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly aſperſed; ſo he ought to take eſpecial care in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of all his Words and Actions, that he may not ſeem to exalt or magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to deſpiſe or underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue others beyond what is not only juſt and true, but alſo neceſſary, either for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ſomething that is good, or the preventing ſomething that is evil. For there is ſcarce any thing that gives greater diſguſt, or helps to render a Man more odious to the World, than an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwardneſs to praiſe and magnifie himſelf, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue others, if he be not neceſſitated thereto by ſome very juſt Reaſon: And on
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40650:164"/> the contrary, there is ſcarce any thing which reconciles a Man more to the Favour and Good Will of People, than when he is not over apt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe much to himſelf, but is ready to give the utmoſt Honour and Reſpect to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that in reaſon can be thought due. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Pride is a Sin, and Humility a Duty,</hi> becauſe the former tends to diſturb, but the latter ſtrengthens and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms humane Society.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. What is incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to do, who has done wrong to another, I have juſt now ſhewn: But if another Man wrongs, or any way endeavours to Injure me; As it is lawful for me (ſo for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40650:165"/> every Man) to ſtand upon my defence, and uſe my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to ſave my ſelf from Wrong, or recover that which is my Right; (for otherwiſe all the good and honeſt Men in the World would continually lie expoſed to the Wrongs and Inſults of any evil Man, who might have a mind to deſtroy them) ſo I, and <hi>every Man ought to be ready</hi> at any time <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to an Adverſary or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> provided it may be upon ſuch terms as are conſiſtent with our own Safety: <hi>Nor ought any Man</hi> upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>to do any greater harm to his keeneſt Enemy, than what he apprehends to be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his own preſervation.</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:40650:165"/> For ſince Society and Peace among Mankind is the Will and deſign of Almighty God; If a breach be made therein by another, I ought for my part to do nothing which may make it wider; but ever to be ready to give a helping hand to the cloſing and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of it.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Hitherto I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to lay down the main and fundamental Rules of that Duty, which every Man is obliged to pay and perform to God, to Himſelf, and to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men. Now to deduce all the particular branches of Virtue and Piety from theſe main Principles; and to ſhew how Morality is improved and refined by the Goſpel to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40650:166"/> the higheſt degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a thing not dificult to be done, but yet inconſiſtent with my deſigned Brevity: For which therefore I muſt refer my Reader to ſome of thoſe Books of Chriſtian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein each Particular of our Duty is, at large, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and preſſed. But in the mean time if we would have a ſhorter Abſtract of our Duty than what I have now been giving; The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furniſhes us with three Rules (two expreſt, and one implied) from which every thing that we can be obliged to do, is eaſily dedueed; And they are, 1. That <hi>we ſhould love God with all our Heart Soul and Strength.</hi> 2. That <hi>we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40650:166"/> ſhould truly love our Selves,</hi> that is to ſay, ſo as always to aim at and purſue our true and chief Happineſs: And 3. That <hi>we ſhould love others as we do our Selves:</hi> Not with the ſame degree of Love; for that is not only unreaſonable, but impoſſible; but with the ſame Reality and Sincerity; or, in other terms, that <hi>we ſhould</hi> ever <hi>do unto all other Men what we would</hi> think rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>that they ſhould do unto us,</hi> if we were in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and they in ours. But beſides theſe general Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incumbent upon all Men; there are divers particular ones, which do ariſe from thoſe ſeveral Relations which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40650:167"/> Men may contract and bear to others, of which it is fit that I give ſome brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. That God would have the Generation of Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and increaſed upon the Earth, is very evident; as well from the natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he has implanted in them (as in all other liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures) to propagate their Kind; as from that Love and Affection which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with other Creatures towards thoſe who ſpring from them. But if Mankind were propagated only by the exerciſe of wild and wandering Luſt, without confinement to any ſetled Rules or Laws; this would
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40650:167"/> bring in ſuch a Deluge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſturbance, as would unavoidably deprive them of the greateſt part of thoſe ſatisfactions which at the preſent they do, or may, enjoy. For if there were no ſuch thing as ſetled Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, we can hardly ſuppoſe that ever there would be any ſort of ſetled Families, which are the firſt beginnings of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and regularity amongſt Men; Fathers would not know which were their own Children, and conſequently would take no care to bring them up, or provide for them; and not only the pain of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the whole trouble of nouriſhing reating and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for Children, would
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40650:168"/> lie, wholly upon the Female Sex, who by themſelves could but very imperfectly perform that work as it ſhould be done. Since therefore God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Comfort and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Men, even whilſt they are here upon Earth, I conclude, that it is his Will, that <hi>Mankind ſhould be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated no other way but by ſetled Marriages,</hi> that is, by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and Agreement between the Male and Female, and that under ſuch Rules as are fit and proper to promote the general Happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which being his great deſign, ought ever alſo to be ours.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. That a Woman ſhould have more than one Husband
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40650:168"/> at a time, is notoriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the deſign of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and therefore directly unlawful: And that a Man ſhould have more than one Wife, at a time, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many, in former Ages; and, at this time, in the Eaſtern Countries, does ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifie to be contrary to that peace and quietneſs which is neceſſary to the Comfort and Happineſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Family; and therefore not ſo agreeable to that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Friendſhip which ought ever to be preſerved amongſt Men; but eſpecially among thoſe who are ſo nearly allyed together. Moreover, if Men and their, Wives ſhould have liberty to part one from the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40650:169"/> other, whenever they pleaſe (beſides the Confuſion and diſturbance which this alſo muſt breed in Families, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where there are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the caſe) Marriage would hardly differ from that wild and wandering Luſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which I have ſpoken in the preceding Paragraph. I conclude therefore, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, before the coming of Chriſt, if a Man took more Wives than one, not for Luſt (which is unlawful §. 24.) but meerly for Propagation; it might in ſome caſes be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with; yet it ever was moſt pleaſing to God, that a Man ſhould have but one Wife at a time; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Death ſhould ever
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40650:169"/> part a Man and his Wife; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the evil Behaviour of one party ſhould make the continuance of the Marriage Compact and Cohabitation, not only ſomething uneaſy (for that for peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake ſhould be born pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently) but down-right into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. But theſe things which Reaſon may perhaps but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly ſuggeſt, the Goſpel has paſſed and eſtabliſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Laws; <hi>viz.</hi> that, <hi>as every Woman is to have but one Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, fo no Man muſt have more than one Wife at a time; nor muſt any thing part Man and Wife but Death,</hi> except it be the caſe of Adultery: And better, much it is, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40650:170"/> be forced to labour under ſome Inconvenience, than that any ſuch Liberty ſhould be allowed as tends to diſturb and diſtract the World.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. We generally find, that all Men, even Heathens as well as Jews and Chriſtians, have conceived a more than ordinary abhorrence againſt the Marriage of ſuch perſons as were very nearly Allyed together within ſome certain Degrees of Relation. And ſince the World is wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a Man to chuſe a Wife, or a Woman a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; thoſe general Rules which are given to us, in Scripture, of providing for things honeſt, not only in the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40650:170"/> ſight of God, but of Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and of taking care, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about ſuch things as are juſt and honeſt, but alſo about ſuch as are lovely and of good report; ſhould teach us that <hi>no perſon ſhould engage in ſuch a Marriage as is by wiſe men commonly reputed to be inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="39">39. Since the relation of Husband and Wife, is wholly owing to the mutual Compact and Agreement which is made between them at their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; the Duties which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from that Relation can be no other but the faithful keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obſerving of that ſame Compact and Agreement, the Conditions of which, may be more or fewer according as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40650:171"/> the parties ſhall think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. But theſe are always neceſſary, and muſt never be wanting; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife muſt ſincerely love each other; muſt be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithful to each others Bed</hi> (without which, mutual Love can never be preſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire) <hi>and</hi> Chriſtianity expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adds, what Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps does alſo obſcurely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that <hi>the Wife muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and obedient to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. When Children are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and brought forth into the World, it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor agreeable to God's deſign, that they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and dye for want of care to be taken of them. Nor are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40650:171"/> there any Perſons upon whom a greater obligation can lye to bring up Children, than upon thoſe who begat them, and were the cauſe of their being: And ſince God intends not the Miſery and Affliction; but generally the Comfort and ſatisfaction of Mankind upon Earth, as well as their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs hereafter in Heaven; I conclude, that <hi>it is ever the Duty of Parents to take the beſt care they can to bring up their Children, and to promote their true Happineſs,</hi> both in this World, and that which is to come. For which reaſon we muſt needs ſuppoſe them to be veſted with a lawful Power of governing and chaſtiſing them, as far as is neceſſary to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40650:172"/> keep them in good and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. And on the other ſide, ſince <hi>Children</hi> are beholding to their Parents, even for their very Being, whereby they are capacitated, not only for the enjoyment of the Satisfactions of this Life, but alſo for etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Happineſs in the World to come; it is highly reaſonable, that they <hi>ſhould love their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with a very high degree of Affection;</hi> and ſhould always be ready to make them the beſt returns of Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that they can. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Parents have been careful in bringing up and making Proviſion for their Children, ſo the Childrens Love and Affection ought
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40650:172"/> ſtill more and more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and expreſſed towards them.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Where Parents, by Death or otherwiſe, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uncapable of nouriſhing and breeding up a Child; or where they utterly forſake and expoſe him to the wide World, before he is able to provide for, or take care of himſelf; If another perſon takes him, and maintains and puts him in a way of living, ſuch <hi>a Child is</hi> in all reaſon <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay a proportionable ſhare of filial Love and Duty to him who has performed the part of a Parent to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="43">43. It is not pretended, that ever any Perſon or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by name, were ever,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40650:173"/> by God's particular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Appointment, inveſted with the Power of governing over ſuch or ſuch a certain People; excepting only the caſe of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I therefore conclude, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>the Magiſtracy which is lawfully eſtabliſhed throughout the World,</hi> is ordained of God; it <hi>is not by immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="44">44. Whether a Parent by the Law of Nature has the Power of a ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate over his own Children, is not neceſſary here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But I ſee no ground in Reaſon or Nature, to judge that the eldeſt Son of any Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſucceſſively ſhould have the ſame Power over his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40650:173"/> and Siſters (who are no way beholding to him for their Being, nor, it may be, for their well-being) and much leſs over his Fathers Brothers and Siſters; as the common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a whole Family may have over all that ſpring from him. I conclude therefore, that <hi>lawful Magiſtracy is not to be derived by the Law of Nature from the alone right of Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture;</hi> Nor do we ever meet with any Prince in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, who derived his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from this only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and if this were the true Right and Title of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, it would follow, that all the World ought to be but one Monarchy; and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heir Male the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40650:174"/> thereof; and all the Kings and Emperours that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, whoſe Titles were originally bottom'd upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation, were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than meer Uſurpers.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Where one Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers another; that is to ſay, by force of Arms, or by Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, gets him ſo into his Power, as that he can deſtroy or kill him at his pleaſure; the conquered perſon indeed, being obliged to do all that honeſtly he can for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his own Life, ought, on that account, to uſe his beſt endeavours by an obſequious Demeanour to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage and pacifie the Fury of the Conquerour. But, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he finds neceſſary to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40650:174"/> his own Preſervation, he is not obliged to obey the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; except he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereto by ſome act of his own; there being no Law of God or Nature which lays any farther Obligation on him in that caſe but only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf, without doing wrong to another. Since then all the World does allow that a Subject is bound to obey the Magiſtrate, who is lawfully ſet over him, even in thoſe caſes where no danger, in this world, would attend his Diſobedience, or, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſſes it, <hi>not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi> It will follow, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt alone,</hi> without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or Agreement, <hi>does not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40650:175"/> eſtabliſh the Conquerour a lawful Magiſtrate over the conquered People.</hi> For if it did, there could be no difference between a Liege Subject, and a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of War.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. If any man unjuſlly invades the Property, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the Life of another, It is lawful for him, to whom the Wrong is offered, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf the beſt he can; And if he has no other way of ſecuring himſelf, nor can prevail with his Enemy to deſiſt from his evil Deſign, the neceſſity of preſerving himſelf from Death, or (which may be as bad, or worſe) from Ruin, will certainly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Killing of him. For otherwiſe the Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40650:175"/> of all honeſt Men muſt for ever be expoſed to the arbitrary pleaſure of every lawleſs and wicked perſon, which is contrary to that comfort and ſatisfactory ſtate, which we ſuppoſe God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to deſign for Men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this Life. And that which is allowable for every ſingle Man to do for himſelf, is ſurely no leſs lawful for a Society of Men combining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to do for their joynt and mutual Safety. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if in ſuch a Society any perſon be taken in, or after, ſuch an unlawful Attempt, it is lawful for them to puniſh him in ſuch a manner (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by death or otherwiſe) as may be neceſſary to terrifie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40650:176"/> others from doing the like for the time to come: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, there could be no ſecurity againſt evil doers; who might contrive to act their Miſchief ſo ſecretly, as not to be killed, or even reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very fact it ſelf. But if ſuch a Society have not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws and Rules to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by in all ſuch caſes, and ſome certain perſons to put thoſe Laws in execution; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man would take upon him to be his own Judge; and what might feem fit and reaſonable to one, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear otherwiſe to another of a contrary intereſt, from whence perpetual Factions and Confuſion muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But there is no reaſon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40650:176"/> that any one, or more of ſuch a Society, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the reſt, ſhould take upon them to make Laws for, or exerciſe Authority over the whole Community. For if it were in every Mans power to make himſelf a Magiſtrate, all might ſet up to be Rulers, and few or none would be Subjects; which would bring in Confuſion, and deſtroy the Society. But when the whole Society do agree and conſent, that ſuch certain perſons ſhall have the exerciſing of ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Powers (which original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in the Body of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety it ſelf) it is then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thoſe perſons to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and they who have conſented to their Authority
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40650:177"/> are, by virtue of that Conſent, obliged to pay Obedience to them. I conclude therefore, that <hi>the Original of Magiſtrates is from the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> ſince there is no other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ground, that I can find, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which to eſtabliſh them. <hi>And when once a legiſlative and executive Power is thus ſetled and eſtabliſhed</hi> by the conſent of a People, who acquieſce in it, and upon all occaſions take ſhelter under its Protection; it is to be looked upon as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed by God's own appointment; and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience is</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>to be paid to it</hi> by every particular perſon who abides within the precincts of its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiction. For this was the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40650:177"/> very caſe of the Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time; and there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame reaſon for it in all other Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Since then Magiſtracy derives it ſelf wholly from the Conſent of the People; from hence it will follow, that <hi>the Original Rule of the Magiſtrates Power and the Subjects obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is</hi> that Conſent which the People has given; or, in other terms, <hi>thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions of the place, in which the Body of the Nation have acquieſced:</hi> Beyond which neither any Magiſtrate ought to command, nor is any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject bound to obey. For where there is no Law, there
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40650:178"/> can be no Tranſgreſſion, nor any Obligation to Obedience; nor conſequently any Right to Command.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. But <hi>if the legiſlative Power of any Nation do enact any thing which is contrary to the expreſs Law of God, or the eternal Laws of good and evil; No particular Man can be bound to obey ſuch a Conſtitution.</hi> For the Authority of God ought to weigh more with us, than that of any Community what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; And it is expresſly ruled in Scripture, that we ought to obey God rather than Man.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. And the ſame Reaſon <hi>(viz.</hi> Self-preſervation) which allows a Society, thus ſetled into a Government, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40650:178"/> Malefactors within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; muſt alſo juſtifie them, it by force of Arms they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt any foreign Enemy, which would wrong or oppreſs them; or endeavour to recover their Right from thoſe who have taken it from them, and refuſe to reſtore it. For otherwiſe it were in vain for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to hope to ſubſiſt by maintaining good Order and Diſcipline at home; if all the while they muſt, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, lye continually expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Wrongs and Inſults of every Enemy which may aſſault them from abroad. I conclude therefore, that <hi>War, whether defenſive or offenſive, may in many caſes, be very juſt and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40650:179"/> lawful:</hi> Nor is there the leaſt word throughout the Holy Scriptures, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Profeſſion of a <hi>Soldier,</hi> who fights under a lawful Authority, as any way contrary to Religion and a good Conſcience: Tho ſuch a Man certainly <hi>ought not only to exerciſe his calling with as much Mildneſs and Humanity as can be conſiſtent with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Country; but alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſatisfie himſelf firſt of the lawfulneſs of the Cauſe</hi> in which he engages, <hi>before he draws his Sword in the Quarrel:</hi> For as we are obliged to do no hurt to any Man whatſoever, if we can avoid it; ſo, for the very ſame reaſon, ought we not to become inſtrumental in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40650:179"/> any Wrong or Injuſtice which another Man (let him be who he will) intends to do.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. That <hi>an humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, together with a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diligence, and an honeſt Fidelity to his Maſter, is the Duty of every Servant,</hi> is moſt apparent; becauſe if a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be either haughty, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, or unfaithful, he ceaſes in effect to be a Servant. And on the other ſide, that <hi>Juſtice and Humanity are</hi> no leſs <hi>the Duty of a Maſter towards his Servant</hi> is altogether as clear, becauſe where theſe are not obſerved, the Condition of a Servant muſt be intolerable, and contrary to that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate which we ſuppoſe God to deſign for all Men;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40650:180"/> and therefore for Servants, who are as much Men, and as much valued by God, and for whom Chriſt died, as well as for their Maſters.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. That <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> are, or (according to Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) <hi>ought to be, combined together into one Society,</hi> which is called <hi>the Church,</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid Part 2. §. 40. Now in all ſuch incorporated Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties theſe three things are ever to be conſidered, 1. What is the Deſign of the perſon or perſons, who firſt gather and inſtitute them? 2. What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage accrues to thoſe who become Members of them? And <hi>3dly.</hi> what are the Laws and Rules to be obſerved by the whole Body, and every
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40650:180"/> Member of it? The Deſign of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who, at the Will of his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, inſtituted and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied the Chriſtian Church, was to purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good works, or, in other terms, by this Incorporation ſo made, more effectually to promote the practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Godlineſs in the World. The benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which every true Member of this Church may propoſe to himſelf, is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of God's Grace and aſſiſtance here for the better performance of his Duty, and the enjoyment of everlaſting Happineſs hereafter; both which are promiſed to us by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40650:181"/> God in and through Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Laws of the Chriſtian Church are either, 1. The general Laws of Piety and Morality, of which I have hitherto been giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; or, 2. Such particular Conſtitutions as are proper to it, conſidered as a congregated and incorporated Body of Men; which I have reſerved to be treated of in the laſt place of all.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. <hi>The firſt thing which is incumbent on every Man,</hi> as (or rather, <hi>in order to become) a Member of the Chriſtian Church, is to be baptized</hi> in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: Which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is intended to put us
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40650:181"/> in mind of that Purity and Cleanneſs from ſin to which we ought to bring our Souls by a virtuous and holy life: And altho to wet or waſh the Body with Water, may ſeem but a ſlight and inconſiderable thing; yet ſince our Saviour Chriſt has expresſly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commanded it, and ſince his Apoſtles were always moſt careful to perform it; inſomuch that even they who had received the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gift of the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, were yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be Baptized, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to become viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; This Ceremony, I think, ought not to be left off, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Altho whether it be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40650:182"/> performed by dipping the Body under the Water, or by ſprinkling the Water upon it, to me ſeems to be altogether indifferent; and to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only by Prudence, or the Cuſtom of particular places. For neither does the word <hi>Baptize</hi> ſignifie any more than to Waſh; which may be done either way; nor does it appear that the Apoſtles dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all thoſe whom they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Moreover, ſince ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as well as dipping, may ſufficiently denote the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cleanſing of the Soul from ſin; and ſince Baptiſm is not expresſly, in the Holy Scripture, determined to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ways, to the excluſion of the other; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40650:182"/> that God has left the matter (ſo far) indifferent to us; and to be ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prudence, as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall at any time direct: And as long as the Subſtance and Deſign of his Command is carefully retained, I ſee no neceſſity of being ſo very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about a Circumſtance of it; except it could evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made appear, that he had appointed and determined it.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. Since then Baptiſm is as the Entrance or Door of Admittance into the Church of Chriſt, it will follow, that all they, and they only who are duly qualified to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, are fit to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40650:183"/> have Baptiſm adminiſtred to them. If any perſon has been brought up out of the Chucrh, until he comes to years of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge; he is then, and only then, qualified to be a Member of the Church, when, having repented of all his former ſins, he believes and owns that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and profeſſes that Faith and Doctrine which he has taught and authorized, and obliges himſelf to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all thoſe Laws and Rules which he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us; this being the very Condition which our Saviour indeſpenſably requires from his Church, and every
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40650:183"/> Member of it, according as they are capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But if a Child be born of Chriſtian Parents, or is ſo in the hands of Chriſtian Guardians, as that it is in their power to bring him up in the true Religion; and they do promiſe and engage ſo to educate him; ſuch a Child as this, even before he comes to any knowledge of things, is yet qualified to be a Member of the Church of Chriſt (upon the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he will perform what God requires from him when he comes to be capable of it) and ſo to continue, if, by Apoſtacy or wickedneſs, he does not, in proceſs of time, ſeparate himſelf again
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40650:184"/> from it. For this, beyond diſpute was the caſe of In ſants, before the coming of Chriſt, who at eight days old (if Males) were to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church of God, and within his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if they were either the Sons, or Servants born in the Houſe, of believing perſons, and who, as well as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are expresſly ſaid to enter into Covenant with God, which is but another expreſſion for becoming of his Church: And no one ſurely will offer to ſay, that the Caſe of Infants is made worſe than it was, by our Saviours coming into the World; eſpecially, ſince he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40650:184"/> has expresſly commanded, that little Children ſhould come unto him, and not be forbidden; for that of ſuch is the Kingdom, that is, the Church of God. I conclude therefore, that not only <hi>adult perſons, who make a due profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> but <hi>alſo ſuch Infants as are in a way of being brought up in the Chriſtian Religion, are,</hi> without any Obſtacle, <hi>to be admitted to Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="54">54. There are ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the New Teſtament, which ſeem plainly to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us, that it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cuſtom with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, to lay their Hands upon all ſuch as had been Baptized (which laying
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40650:185"/> on of Hands was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with Prayer to God) in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit of God: But that this was a thing poſitively preſcribed, and commanded, I do not find clearly proved: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, altho I dare not haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn thoſe particular Churches, where this ſame Cuſtom is diſuſed or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet ſince the Grace and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, in order to the leading of a good life, and obtaining e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs, is for ever continued unto the Church, as I have ſaid Part 2. §. 42. and therefore ought ever to be ſought for (altho the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40650:185"/> of Miracles and ſpeaking of all Languages, without learning them, be ceaſed from amongſt us) I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the laying on of Hands upon perſons that have been baptized, together with Prayer to God for their growth and continuance in Grace, which is commonly called <hi>Confirmation, is a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and godly Cuſtom, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fit to be continued in the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="55">55. As every particular Man whatſoever is obliged, in his own private perſon, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhip God; ſo <hi>the Church, being a Society in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated for the better ſerving of God, is under an Obligation</hi> to do the ſame in her aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40650:186"/> capacity, that is to ſay, <hi>to aſſemble together for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> And becauſe the whole Number of Chriſtians, which are diſperſed over the Face of the Earth, are not capable of meeting together in one place; the Univerſal Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lies under a neceſſity of ſubdividing it ſelf into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches; and thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, according as they find to be moſt convenient for the purſuing that ſame end for which they are ſo incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Moreover, ſince all theſe particular Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are ſtill, or ought to be, but Parts and Members of that One Catholick Church which our Saviour Chriſt has
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40650:186"/> appointed and founded, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that none of them ought to conſtitute or act any thing amongſt themſelves, which may give a juſt occaſiou for the breaking of that Union and Concord which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and has commanded always to be maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. But on the contrary, Matters ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where ſo to be ordered, as that if a Member of any one particular Church ſhould tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into any other part of the World, he may meet with nothing in any Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, where he comes, which juſtly ſhould be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to him from aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling or communicating with it.</p>
                  <p n="56">
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:40650:187"/>56. <hi>The particular acts to be performed in theſe Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, are all ſuch as tend to the Edification of the People</hi> in Virtue and Godlineſs (which is the deſign of their Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration) and conſequently, to the promoting of each mans eternal Salvation (which is the end that every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is ſuppoſed to purſue.) All which are reducible to theſe Two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Devotion towards God, which includes Confeſſion of ſins, Prayer for all things neceſſary, both for themſelves and others, and Praiſing of God, as well for his own Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as for his Love and Beneficence to all Mankind: And 2. the Inſtruction of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40650:187"/> People which are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; which is to be done by Reading and Explaining the Holy Scriptures, Catechizing, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is one act of Devotion towards God to be performed in ſuch publick Aſſemblies, which is commonly known by the name of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or the Holy Communion; of which it will be fit to ſay ſomething more particularly, becauſe it is an Ordinance altogether of poſitive Inſtitution, as well as Baptiſm, of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. As our Saviours Death and Paſſion, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went for the ſins of the whole World, ſhould ever out of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40650:188"/> Gratitude, be remembred by us in the moſt emphatical and affecting manner; ſo except we have, every one of us, a ſhare and intereſt in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement which he thereby made to God for us, we cannot, by the Terms of the Goſpel, hope for eternal Salvation. In order then to both theſe Ends <hi>he himſelf</hi> before his Death <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, as a perpetual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> for ever to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Church, <hi>that Bread ſhould be bleſſed, broken, and eaten; and a Cup alſo bleſſed, diſtributed and drank, in ſuch aſſemblies as ſhould meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Name,</hi> not only as a Remembrance of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for us, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewn forth and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40650:188"/> but alſo as the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is to ſay, the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of his Body and Blood unto, and the participation of them, by all faithful and good Chriſtians. To ſay with the Roman Church, that the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, being bleſſed or conſecrated in this Ordinance, are tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated or turned into the very, real Subſtance, of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſo as that that very ſame Body of his which was crucified, and that Blood which was ſhed, are wholly and intirely received into the bodily Mouth, and ſwallowed down by every Communicant, does not only draw after it ſuch monſtrous Abſurdities, as no Man, I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40650:189"/> think, without renouncing his Reaſon, can digeſt, nor can be inferred from any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture interpreted according to the Rules which I have laid down, Part 1. §. 25. and 33. But is alſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary even to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as Meaning of the New Teſtament; in which the Bread, in this Holy Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is plainly called Bread (and by the ſame Rule the Wine muſt ſtill remain Wine, as to its natural ſubſtance) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after the Bleſſing or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of it. As therefore I muſt needs conclude, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt are not received by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church after that manner, which they of <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40650:189"/> do define; ſo muſt it alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that their Worſhiping of the Hoſt and pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt in the Maſs, together with their depriving the Laity of the Cup (which beſides other Abſurdities do wholly depend upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation) are none other than meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and unlawful Inventions and practices. But ſince a Man may then be ſaid truly to receive and partake of any thing, tho at never ſo great a diſtance from him, when he has a real Intereſt in it, and enjoys the Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it (as a Man may have an Eſtate, and reap the Profits of it, tho it lies in a far diſtant Country) I do
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40650:190"/> therefore conclude, that the way whereby we do receive, or communicate in, the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by this Ordinance, is by being made Partakers of thoſe Benefits which by the Crucifying of his Body, and the ſhedding of his Blood do accrue to us; and that whoſoever eats of this Bread, and drinks of this Cup in ſuch a manner as Chriſt has appointed, has thereby aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly a ſhare of thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits held forth and conveyed unto him.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. How often <hi>this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is to be practiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated</hi> in every Congregation, is not expresſly determined, either by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and therefore can only
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40650:190"/> be regulated by the Prudence of the Church it ſelf: But common Reaſon will tell us, that it ſhould be <hi>ſo often at leaſt, as may be ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a freſh and lively Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Sufferings of our Saviour in the minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> this being one main End of its firſt Inſtitution And ſo often therefore ought every Chriſtian, who is arrived to years of underſtanding (for ſuch only are capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in remembrance of another) to come and be partakers of it. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn or neglect this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſuch a peculiar End, argues a great ſlight and diſregard of his Death and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40650:191"/> Paſſion (beſides the Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Command) and therefore is juſtly to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a very great and hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. As it is a great Affront, and even a Mocking of God, for a Man to draw near to him in any of his Ordinances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſincere and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart (for which Reaſon Hypocriſy in Scripture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as moſt odious, and the Prayer and Sacrifice of a wicked Man, whilſt he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſuch, is ſaid to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination unto God) ſo does he ſeem to reſent ſuch a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in no inſtance more than in this of the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of which he who eats and drinks unworthily, is expeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40650:191"/> ſaid by the Apoſtle to be quilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and to eat and drink damnation to himſelf: Which Expreſſions altho they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently interpreted by divers perſons, yet in whatever ſenſe we take them, they do abundantly ſhew, that God is in a particular manner offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with thoſe, who any way profane this ſacred Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>It</hi> therefore <hi>is the Duty,</hi> and ought very much to be the concern, <hi>of every Chriſtian firſt, to examin himſelf,</hi> and to make the beſt trial and enquiry that he can, whether he be truly ſincere in his reſolutions of ſerving and obeying God faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all his life-long (for any perſon who is thus diſpoſed,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40650:192"/> and none other, is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God) <hi>And then</hi> with Devotion and Reverence ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto ſuch Sincerity, <hi>to</hi> come and <hi>eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup:</hi> That as, on the one ſide, he may not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what Chriſt has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and required; ſo, on the other, he may not incur the Penalty which is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an unworthy Receiver.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. He that worſhips or prays to God by himſelf alone, may do it as well by offering up only the inward Thoughts and Deſires of his Mind, which are clearly ſeen and known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as by expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf outwardly by Words; which tho even in our private Devotions they may be very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40650:192"/> proper to keep our Minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon what we are about, yet are no way neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form God of what we think or wiſh for. But when a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Men do meet to joyn together in God's worſhip, their Devotion muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be outwardly expreſſed in Words; becauſe there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of keeping their Thoughts (wherein their Worſhip does conſiſt) united and joyned together. And ſince Words not underſtood are in effect the ſame with no Words at all; I conclude, that <hi>the Language wherein the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any Church</hi> or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <hi>is offered up to God, muſt always be ſuch as is well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Aſſembly of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40650:193"/> who meet together.</hi> Nor does even the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation amaze me more than that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould own the <hi>14th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be the Word of God, and yet have all their publick Services every where performed in the Latine Tongue only, which is not now underſtood by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of any Nation in the World.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40650:194"/> may know of before it comes, and accordingly prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it by laying aſide, for that time, his worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Diſorder and Confuſion (which is the natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Uncertainty) muſt needs follow. That one Day at leaſt, in ſeven was expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required by God, under the Moſaick Law, to be ſanctified and ſet a part for his Service, is beyond diſpute. That the Obſervation of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or the laſt Day of the Week is not required from the Chriſtian Church, to me ſeems very evident from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reckoning it amongſt the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory <hi>Shadows</hi> of the old Law, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. But that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought not to be behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40650:194"/> with the Jews, in ſetting apart a proportion of our time for God's Service, I think will follow as well from the great Mercies which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him; for which we, no leſs than they, ought to ſhew and expreſs our Thankfulneſs; as alſo from that general Rule which our Saviour has given us, that our Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees. And that accordingly one Day in ſeven, namely the Firſt Day of the Week (which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is therefore called the Lord's Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.) has ever been ſo ſet apart for the Service of God in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, I preſume will
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40650:195"/> be denied by none; As alſo, that the Reaſon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles making choice of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Day, was in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Saviour's glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection, which on that Day was performed, and whereby their Faith in him, which began to waver, was confirmed and raiſed above all doubt or diffidence. Now ſince no Reaſon can be given, or ſo much as imagined why this Day ſhould be changed for any other Day of the Week; I do from what has been ſaid conclude, that <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> or Firſt Day of the Week, <hi>ought for ever to be kept holy in the Chriſtian Church; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly dedicated to the Service of God.</hi> And where either
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40650:195"/> the Church univerſal, or any particular Church has ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide any other days to be kept holy, in remembrance either of any of God's Mercies to us; or of the Martyrdom of any of his choſen Saints, who ſealed the Truth of the Goſpel with their Lives, and tranſmitted it ſo confirmed down unto us; or as Days of Faſting or Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, in order to humble our ſelves before God for our Sins; ſince in all this there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to God's Law; nor any thing but what may be well conſiſtent with, and ſerviceable to, true Piety; It will follow from what I have ſaid, § 61. That every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch a Church is obliged to keep and obſerve theſe ſame
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40650:196"/> other Holy Days, ſo far as no way to give Scandal, diſturb the Order, or break the Peace of the Church which has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed them.</p>

But care on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ought ever to be taken, that Modes and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies be not ſo multiplied as to become uneaſy and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or diſtract the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People. Now there being no ſuch fixed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40650:196"/> Rules of Decency and Order, but what will have a different reliſh with different Men, according to their ſeveral Educations, and Cuſtoms to which they may have been uſed; it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, if not impoſſible, for any Church ſo to regulate theſe external matters as to pleaſe every Mans Fancy, and give diſguſt to none: For what ſome may think to be but decent, others may take to be too formal or pompous; and what theſe may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be ſuitable to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Chriſtianity, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort may look on as mean and jejune. As therefore the Church in this caſe can do no more, but act according to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40650:197"/> the beſt of her Prudence; ſo ſince every Man cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have his particular Fancy in theſe things pleaſed and gratified; <hi>It will</hi> evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>appear to be the Duty of each private Chriſtian, ſo far to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with every ſuch conſtitution of the Church where he dwells</hi> (provided there be nothing in it which is ſinful) <hi>as not to break the Peace and Unity, or diſturb the Order of the Church on that account.</hi> But if any Church ſhall offer to impoſe any Ceremonies or practices whatſoever (which God has not preſcribed, and which therefore are in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different) not for Decency and Order; but as things in themſelves Holy, or abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40650:197"/> neceſſary to Salvation (as ſome of old would have done by the Jewiſh Ceremonies) with ſuch Impoſitions as theſe no Chriſtian ought at all to comply; nor ſuffer his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Conſcience to be thus burthened: But <hi>every Man muſt ſtand faſt in that Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free;</hi> tho at the ſame time he muſt be very careful not to pretend, or uſe this Liberty as a Cloke of Maliciouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. Since different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of Religion are generally apt to beget Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Animoſities between thoſe who entertain them, as our dayly Experience does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teſtifie; It ought to be the Church's, and every
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40650:198"/> private Chriſtian's endeavour, that all Men may become of one and the ſame Judgment, or at leaſt, that there may be as few Differences amongſt them as is poſſible. <hi>When</hi> therefore <hi>any religious Diſpute ariſes,</hi> whereby the Church's Peace and Unity is like to be endangered, <hi>It is free and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for</hi> (Nor is there any thing which ſhould hinder) <hi>either the Church univerſal, or any particular Church,</hi> or even any prudent Men whatſoever, <hi>to declare and publiſh their ſenſe of the matter</hi> in debate. But as no Man can be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Determination of any Church or party whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any farther than he is convinced and ſatisfied of its
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40650:198"/> agreement with Reaſon and the Holy Scriptures, Part 2. §. 1, and 2. ſo is not any Man bound to oppoſe or diſpute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt an Error it ſelf; except there be ſomething in it which is injurious to Chriſtian Faith or practice; and conſequently which may prove pernicious to Men's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And therefore if ſuch a Miſtake, which may have prevailed in any Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be rectified without endangering the breach of Peace and Charity (becauſe they who hold it, it may be, are obſtinately wedded to it) I think <hi>it is the Duty of us all</hi> to be very tender in ſuch a caſe, and to permit every Man freely to abound in his own
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40650:199"/> Senſe, until ſuch time as God ſhall think fit to bring them to a clearer ſight of the Truth. And <hi>by no means to renounce the Communion of any Church on the account of any Error that is not damnable;</hi> and much leſs on account only of ſuch Terms or Expreſſions as are but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe or of doubtful ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For otherwiſe ſince the Apprehenſions of Men are ſo very different (eſpecially in ſuch things as being remote from our Senſes are matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of rational Speculation) if Difference of Opinion upon ſuch theological Queſtions, as do not immediately concern our Salvation, were a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for Separation in point of Communion, there
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40650:199"/> would ſoon be probably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many Churches as Men in the World. But if any Church ſhall require from a Man, either to comply with, or practiſe, any thing, which is, not only againſt his Fancy in point of Decency or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, but alſo againſt his Conſcience in point of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; or that he ſhould not only be ſilent and not oppoſe, but alſo explicitly profeſs the Belief of, any ſuch Doctrines as he judges to be falſe (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever innocent the Belief of them may be to them who think them true) and if ſuch a Church ſhall refuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her Communion to all thoſe who will not joyn with her upon theſe Terms; We
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40650:200"/> muſt rather be contented to be excluded from ſuch a Church's Communion, than to purchaſe it by ſolemnly telling a down right Lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the World, or by the violation of any other of God's Commands: For if we offer to do Evil that Good may come of it, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has declared us to be in a ſtate of Damnation.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. For the due regulation of every Society, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it have a Power, ſomewhere or other veſted in it, over its own Members, either to compel them to live orderly, according to its Laws and Conſtitutions, or, if any of them are diſobedient and refractory, and will not,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40650:200"/> upon due admonition, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; wholly to exclude them from the Body of the Community. For, otherwiſe, if the Members of any Society may at their pleaſure break its Conſtitutions, and violate its Laws without control, this would be wholly to pull down the Encloſure, and lay all open and common, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and conſequently, in effect to diſſolve the Society it ſelf. And accordingly <hi>our Saviour has given the Church a Power to admoniſh and rebuke thoſe who give any ſcandal by their ungodly and unruly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; and if</hi> upon this <hi>they do not repent and reform, of rejecting and cutting them off from her Communion.</hi> Which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40650:201"/> Authority muſt ever be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with due mildneſs and caution, for the edification, and not with heat and fury, which in the end would more probably tend to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. But if any Church ſhall go beyond this to puniſh or perſecute Men, with Fire and Sword or with Fines and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only for being of a different perſuaſion from, and refuſing to communicate with, her; In my Opinion ſhe herein acts contrary to that Mildneſs and Gentleneſs which the Goſpel upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions preſcribes; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the caſe of dealing with thoſe who oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24.

                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:40650:202"/>66: And as Almighty God in his Mercy is pleaſed not to cut the greateſt ſinners off from all hopes of pardon; but is ready at any time, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their true and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to receive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his Favour, ſo has he committed unto <hi>the Church</hi> the miniſtry of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which Church therefore accordingly <hi>ought not only to endeavour to bring ſinners to Repentance by Preaching. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and Exhortation; but alſo wherever ſhe ſees evident Marks and Tokens of it in any perſon</hi> (of which yet there ought to be good aſſurance) for his greater comfort and eaſe of Conſcience, <hi>to remit</hi> or abſolve him from <hi>his ſins,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40650:202"/> and reſtore him again to</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and privilege of <hi>Chriſtian Communion,</hi> of which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he has, or ought to have, been deprived: And whatever Sentence of thus binding or looſing, remitting or retaining of Men's ſins is duly and regularly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Church upon Earth, our Saviour aſſures us it ſhall be ratified and confirmed by God in Heaven. But that a Man is obliged to make a particular Confeſſion of all his ſins unto any other perſon, except God, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Pardon of, or Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from them; as I no where find it aſſerted in the Holy Scripture; ſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Roman Divines
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40650:203"/> do allege for it, is very weak and unconcluding: For it is not the particular Confeſſion of a Man's ſins (which may be performed by the moſt hardened impenitent) but his Contrition, and the viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his life (which may ſufficiently appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular Confeſſion) that only can enable the Church or her Miniſters to judge whether he truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of his ſins or not, and conſequently whether he be a proper Object of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the Church's Favour. Altho I deny not but that in ſome caſes it may be very proper for a Man to make known the diſeaſes of his Soul to a prudent Spiritual
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40650:203"/> Phyſician, that he may have his advice for the cure of them. And his Duty alſo to make an open Confeſſion of his ſins whenever it is neceſſary for God's Glory, or to repair any publick ſcandal which has been given by him.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. That Almighty God, even where he has pardoned a Man's ſins upon his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, may yet, on the ſcore of thoſe very ſins which he has ſo pardoned, lay ſome ſharp and ſevere temporal Afflictions upon the penitent, either to keep him more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually from ſinning for the time to come, or that it may be a Terror to others; or for many other reaſons beſt known to himſelf, is a thing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40650:204"/> that cannot be diſputed. But from hence to infer, that theſe temporal Afflictions, if not laid on us in this World, are to be undergone in Purgatory, and that therefore, for the preventing them, it is fit and neceſſary <hi>that Penance ſhould be impoſed by way of ſatisfaction, or Indulgences granted by way of Remiſſion;</hi> and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Warrant from the Holy Scripture, ſave only a faint and forced Conſequence from ſome few perverted Texts; <hi>is a thing</hi> ſo <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and precarious,</hi> that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes me to think how Men can ſuffer themſelves to be ſo grosſly impoſed upon. And whoſoever ſhall duly conſider upon what weak grounds the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40650:204"/> Pope and his Prelates do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a Power of diſpenſing and diſtributing the Merits of Chriſt unto the People by way of Indulgence (as if they alone had the keeping of that Treaſure under Lock and Key; and to which, tho, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, they have yet added the Merits of the Saints to make their Treaſure more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant) will, I think, very much wonder that their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ſo free to part with their earthly Treaſure in purchaſing theſe Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon no better ſecurity.</p>

And that in this they did no more than what Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had expresſly commanded them, is moſt reaſonable and probable to ſuppoſe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the anointing with Oyl, which is mentioned by St. <hi>James, c. 5. v.</hi> 14. was intended for the very ſame purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> the raiſing up the ſick perſon and reſtoring him to Health, is as apparent as any thing can be form the very Context.

But what juſt ground the Church of Rome can have from either of theſe, or any other place of Scripture for the divine Inſtitution of their Extreme Unction, which they make uſe of for a far different end, namely the preparing thereby of perſons who are paſt hopes of recovery, for their paſſage into the next life, is more than I am able to find out.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. As the Body natural would be but a confuſed and uſeleſs Lump, if it were not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40650:207"/> diſtinguiſhed into the ſeveral Members, which are neceſſary for its own Service and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: And as the Body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick would be but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Rabble, if there were not Magiſtrates ſetled to rule and govern, and miniſterial Officers appointed to perform all neceſſary Functions in and about it; ſo the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as Reaſon, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us (and the practice of the apoſtolical Church, which is there recorded, confirms it) that the like Appointment and diſtinction of Offices are no leſs neceſſary in the Church; in order to the regular and orderly government of it, and the due execution of all its Laws and Conſtitutions. But
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40650:207"/> how far theſe Offices are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and appointed by the Law of God, or how far left to be ſetled, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prudence of the Church, according as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may render it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, is what I ſhall not take upon me to pronounce my Sentence in. But <hi>whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Polity or eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſetled and acquieſced in, either by the whole Church in general, or by that of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Country in particular, I think, ought quietly to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to by every one who would be a Member of ſuch reſpective Church,</hi> except there appears to him to be either ſomething therein, which is not only uncommanded, but even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Nor can I apprehend that any leſs Warrant can be ſufficient for breaking or endangering the Peace or Unity of the Church (the preſervation of which is ſo often and ſo earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us in the Holy Scripture) beſides the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of obeying the Poſitive Command of God himſelf. And therefore, ſince the Government of the Church by Biſhops, that is to ſay, by certain perſons having in their ſeveral Diſtricts a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority among, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40650:208"/> a Superiority over, the Presbyters; has for ſo many Ages been univerſally ſetled amongſt, and acquieſced in by, all Chriſtians in all parts of the World; I cannot find how they can be excuſed, who (without any neceſſity for ſo doing) have ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet themſelves, not only to retrench the Exceffes, and rectifie the Abuſes of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Power; but alſo to pull down, and wholly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, the very Order it ſelf; to the no ſmall ſcandal of thoſe who think that ſo univerſal a Conſtitution, every where taking place, even in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, could be grounded on no leſs than an Apoſtolick Ordinance (of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40650:209"/> which there ſeems to be ſome, not obſcure, Foot-ſteps in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament) and that moſt probably in conformity to that Imparity which Chriſt himſelf eſtabliſhed between the Apoſtles and the ſeventy Diſciples; who were yet both commiſſioned by him to preach the Goſpel.</p>

But then on the other ſide, good care ought ever to be taken by the Church, that no perſons be entruſted with any ſacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but ſuch as are duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for it; And that ſuch a Maintainance be provided and ſetled for every ſuch perſon, as that he may not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to neglect the publick Service of God and the due

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40650:210"/> take notice that <hi>Religion does not conſiſt in Terms of Art or forms of expreſſion;</hi> but in the belief and practice of ſuch things as God has made known, and requires from us; And it is too common among Men to wrangle about Words, before they have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed and agreed upon the meaning of them. I have not, for example, made uſe of this Term <hi>Juſtification;</hi> But yet I have endeavoured to ſhew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what conditions a ſinner obtains the Pardon of his ſins and Mercy at the hand of God; which is the ſame thing: Nor have I ſaid any thing of the nature or number of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:</hi> But I have ſpoken what I thought might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40650:211"/> concerning Baptiſm, the Holy Communion, and thoſe other things which the Church of Rome calls by that name. And if once I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied touching any thing, how far God requires it from us, and whether or no it be neceſſary to Salvation; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee why I ſhould trouble my ſelf much in enquiring, whether ſuch a thing may properly be called a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or not, which to me ſeems no more but a diſpute about the meaning of a Word. True indeed, it is, that in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, which I have delivered, Part 2. §. 22. I have expresſly made uſe of the Terms <hi>perſon, ſubſtance, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe I could find none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40650:211"/> ſo fit and proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Thoughts; Nor durſt I venture in ſo ſublime a matter to apply new Words to thoſe things of which I can have but very imperfect and obſcure Conceptions. And having thus ſaid all that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon this occaſion, I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit the Whole to the Judgment and Cenſure of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reader; leaving him to that liberty which I my ſelf always deſire to enjoy; and being ready to retract any thing that I have ſaid, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I am convinced that I have been therein miſtaken.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. HOW thoſe Perſons who take unto themſelves the diſtinguiſhing Name of <hi>Vnitarians</hi> do diſſent from the main Body of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Church or Perſwaſion, touching the Doctrines of the Trinity, and the Incarnation of our Saviour Chriſt, is ſo well known, that I need not here offer to open or explain in the Terms of the Controverſie which is managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Now when in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the <hi>Vnitarians</hi> are preſt with ſome paſſages of Scripture, which ſeem very evidently to make againſt them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40650:215"/> beſides other ways which they have to avoid the force of them, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have recourſe to the nature of the thing controverted; and preſs their Adverſaries back again with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How ſuch a thing can poſſibly be? And when to this it is reply'd, That there is evidently no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſound Reaſon in the Doctrines themſelves, and that the Truth of them ought ot be believed upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, who hath revealed them: But that the manner of them is utterly above, and altogether incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our finite and narrow Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and therefore not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after. In return to this, there are ſome who maintain, that if theſe Doctrines were not contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet this alone is a ſufficient cauſe to reject them, that they are confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above it. For of that which is above our Reaſon (ſay they) we can form no true Conception, or Idea; and it is abſurd, or rather impoſſible for a Man to believe, that which he cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly ſo much as conceive or apprehend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the right ſtating and clearing of this whole Controverſie, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40650:215"/> ſuch hints in the <hi>Gentleman's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Part 1. Sect. 33. Part 2. 22, 23, 37. as I thought to be moſt fit for Men of ordinary Capacity, and moſt ſuitable to that brevity which I all along defigned. But in this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, I ſhall addreſs my ſelf unto thoſe, who are of a more refined Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accuſtomed to a more exact way of thinking; and try if I can give them any ſatisfaction in a Matter, which ſeems to be not a little perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perhaps by the overmuch Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome of both the contending Parties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That our Knowledge of things is but ſhort and imperfect, is confeſſed on all ſides. It is alſo very evident, that no Language whatſoever will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us variety of Words ſufficient to expreſs all the Diverſities and Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities of our Thoughts, ſo as to ſecure them from the Miſtakes of Ignorance, or Miſapprehenſion, and the Cavils of Perverſeneſs; but that after all our Care, our moſt cautious Expreſſions will ſometimes be liable to be miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to a contrary, or at leaſt, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a different meaning, from what we intended. And therefore the moſt

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40650:217"/> Acute and Judicious Writer will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably find himſelf much miſtaken, if he at any time hopes ſo to handle any Controverſie as to ſatisfie every Man. But ſince, upon the ſtricteſt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have been able to make, I am my ſelf fully convinced of the Truth of what I have concluded in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, I will now (with God's Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) try, whether I can expreſs my Thoughts with ſo much clearneſs, and prove them with ſuch ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pertinent Inſtances, as may give ſome Satisfaction to others alſo: And that I may the more effectually do this, I ſhall endeavour to proceed as near as I can in ſuch a Method, as is always uſed. in Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This word <hi>Doctrine</hi> is but another Term for a <hi>Propeſition;</hi> and what a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> is, or when it is ſaid to be true or falſe, certain, probable, or doubtful, I need not ſpend time to explain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is that faculty in Man (for I meddle not with the Knowledge of Angels) whereby he apprehends, things, and their Attributes or Properties; and frames a Judgment concerning what he apprehends. And alſo from thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40650:217"/> which he makes, draws ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more immediate, or more remote and diſtant Conſequences.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Truth of ſome Propoſitions is ſo very plain, that as no Man in his Senſes can deny them, ſo is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find out any thing which is more plain whereby to prove them. And ſuch Propoſitions as theſe I call <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident:</hi> Such for Example are, That <hi>all the parts of a thing taken together are equal to the whole.</hi> That <hi>both parts of a Contradiction cannot be true at the ſame time;</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the Truth of a Propoſition does not immediately appear by its own light, but yet the Propoſition can, beyond queſtion, be proved from other Propoſitions which are ſelf-evident; ſuch a Propoſition as this I term to be <hi>built upon Reaſon alone.</hi> Such for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are, That <hi>two Triangles, having equal baſes, and being contained between the ſame parallel Lines, are equal;</hi> and all other Propoſitions which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being demonſtrated, or clearly proved from the bare Principles of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Where the poſſibility of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>(i. e.</hi> that it implyes no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40650:218"/> can be evidently proved from the Principles of Reaſon alone, but yet the actual Truth and Reality of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the ſame way be made appear, ſuch a Propoſition as this I call <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to Reaſon.</hi> Thus for Example; That <hi>an Oak ſhould grow up to its full and uſual Stature, in an hour,</hi> is as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (that is to ſay, as free from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) as that it ſhould do the ſame in an hundred years; (for all growth is motion, and the ſwiftneſs of motion may be for ever increaſed) but that ever this was actually ſo, cannot be proved by any Arguments drawn from Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Where any Propoſition (either immediately in it ſelf, or mediately in its Conſequences) does plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any other Propoſition which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf-evident, or built upon Reaſon, ſuch a Propoſition as this I term to be <hi>contrary to Reaſon;</hi> ſuch for Example is this Propoſition, That <hi>the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a Triangle are equal to three right Angles,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where a Propoſition is in it ſelf true, but we are unable clearly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or frame a Notion or Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things contained under the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40650:218"/> terms of it, ſuch a Propoſition I term to be <hi>above Reaſon.</hi> And a Propoſition may be either wholly and altogether above our Reaſon, when we can frame no manner of Conception of the things ſpoken of, or elſe but partly above it, when ſome Notions of the things we have, but thoſe very obſcure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Thus the Doctrine of Light and Colours, is wholly above the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Man born blind, who can frame no manner of Notion of theſe things from the Deſcription which others make of them, becauſe he is altogether deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of proper Organs to receive any Impreſſion from the things themſelves. But the ſame Doctrine would not be ſo much above the Reaſon of a Man, who had ſome faint and confuſed glimmering of Sight; tho' ſtill much more above his Reaſon than it would be if he were endowed with the ſacul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of clear and diſtinct Sight, as other Men commonly are.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To <hi>know,</hi> is to give aſſent to a Propoſition when it evidently appears to be built upon Reaſon. But when the Truth of a Propoſition is aſſented to, not upon Arguments drawn from the Reaſon, or the Nature of the thing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40650:219"/> but upon account of the Veracity, and Authority of the Perſon or Perſons who affirm it; ſuch a Propoſition as that is ſaid to be <hi>believed.</hi> Furthermore, If a Man underſtands not the meaning of a Propoſition, and yet believes that it contains a Truth in it, becauſe of the deference he pays to the Perſon who ſpeaks it; this I call an <hi>implicit belief:</hi> And properly ſpeaking, the Object of ſuch a belief is not the Truth of the Propoſition it ſelf, but only the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Speaker. But where a Man underſtands the meaning of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which he believes, this I call an <hi>Explicit Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>No Man can poſſibly believe or give his Aſſent to any Doctrine or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which appears to him to be contrary to Reaſon,</hi> (ſee Sect. 9.) For to own a Propoſition to be ſelf-evident, or built upon Reaſon, and yet at the ſame time to believe another which mediately, or immediately, is contradictory to it, is abſolutely impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>If a Propoſition be reconcilable to Reaſon,</hi> (Sect. 8.) and the Truth of it alſo teſtified by ſuch Perſons whoſe Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is beyond all doubt, or exception; ſuch a Propoſition cannot but be believed by any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40650:219"/> 
                     <hi>one unto whom it comes ſo teſtified.</hi> For if it be reconcilable to Reaſon, then it may poſſibly be true; <hi>(Sect.</hi> 8.) and if I am actually convinced of the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſon or Perſons, who relate it, I cannot chooſe but believe that it is True. From whence I think it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that Revelation, or the Teſtimony of another, may juſtly be looked upon, not only as <hi>a means of Information,</hi> but alſo <hi>a motive of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi> whatever a late Author ſays to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But that which is moſt material in this preſent Controverſie, is what I am now going to make appear, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>a Man may have moſt ſufficient, and cogent Arguments, to give his Aſſent to ſuch Propoſitions as are not only in part, but wholly, and altogether above his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> (Sect. 10.) For the clear and plain evincing of which, I ſhall crave leave to make a Relation of a Conference which once I had with a blind Man; to whom, when I underſtood that he had been quite blind from his Infancy, and never could remember to have ſeen the leaſt glimmering of Light, I had the Curioſity to put ſeveral queſtions. I asked him firſt of all, Whether ever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40650:220"/> he had endeavoured to frame any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conception, of Light or Colours, of which I ſuppoſe he had often heard mention to be made in common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe? To which he anſwered me, That he had often endeavoured it with the greateſt Application of his Mind that poſſibly he could. And to that end and purpoſe he had made it his Buſineſs to ask all the queſtions he could think of, whereby to get Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but all to no purpoſe; for that he was ſtill altogether as ignorant of the Nature of Light and Colours, and as unable to frame any Conception of them, as if he had never before heard the Names of them. He told me moreover, that he was a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would, or could believe, that other Men had any faculty at all which he wanted. For, ſays he, I was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of no Defect or Imperfection in my ſelf, but believed my ſelf to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as perfect as all other Men with whom I converſed; and therefore when they told me that I was blind, and talked to me of Light and Colours, I apprehended for a great while, that they did it only to impoſe upon me. But are you now convinced, ſaid I,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40650:220"/> that you are blind; and that other Men have the faculty of Sight, which you want? Yes, replied he, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied and convinced of it. How can that be, ſaid I. when you can frame no manner of Notion of Light or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which are the Objects of Sight? Thus anſwered he, I was convinced of it: They would put me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, and yet would tell me every thing that I did; as whether I ſtood, or ſate, or held up my Hand, or let it down, or the like: Whereas I could not not diſcover any thing which they did, except I were cloſe to them, and felt them carefully with my Hands. Now by this, continued he, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, that other Men have a faculty which I want, whereby they can diſcover and diſtinguiſh things at a diſtance, which they call <hi>Sight:</hi> And I am told by all Men, that there is ſomething called <hi>Light,</hi> which is diffuſed through the Air, and is the Inſtrument whereby they are enabled to exerciſe this faculty; and alſo that the <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Shape</hi> of things are the Objects upon which the ſame is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. But although I can by my touch diſtinguiſh between the different
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40650:221"/> ſhapes of ſome things, and ſo can frame a Notion of <hi>Shape:</hi> Yet what <hi>Light</hi> is, or what <hi>Colours</hi> are, I have not the leaſt Conception; although I am, as I have told you, ſufficiently convinced, that ſome ſuch things there are. Now this Relation being (for the ſubſtance of it) true; to my own Knowledge, or at leaſt (as every Man will own it to be) poſſible and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; it will evidently follow, without any farther proof, that this Man had very good and unqueſtionable grounds to believe ſome things that were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether above his Reaſon; for what Sight, Light, or Colours were, he was utterly uncapable of framing, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, any Idea. But yet that there were ſuch things, and that all he heard Men diſcourſe about them was not meer Fiction, (as he for ſome time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) was plainly proved to him by ſuch Arguments as every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man muſt allow to have been abundantly ſufficient to move his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Nor was this Aſſent of his which he gave unto theſe things, a bare impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Belief; <hi>(Sect.</hi> 11.) as if he had been told that ſomething did Exiſt, which was called <hi>Blictri;</hi> but was altogether
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40650:221"/> ignorant of what was ſignified by that word, (as Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> ſpeaks.) For ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was abſolutely impoſſible for him to frame any direct Notion, or Conception, of the things themſelves, yet by thoſe analogous Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were made to him of them, he well might be, and was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only fully convinced, that what was ſpoken concerning them, was not inſignificant Nonſenſe; but alſo enabled to frame ſome ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Conception of them, which is more than a Man can do of <hi>Blictri;</hi> of which he hears only the ſound, but knows not the Signification. For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Man at the very time of his Birth, to be utterly deprived of his Organs of Sight; yet, by the uſe of his other four Senſes, he may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a faculty of Senſation is; and how a ſenſible quality, or the ſmall Particles of Matter flowing, or rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Body, and ſtriking upon the proper Organ of Senſe, do make ſuch a peculiar Impreſſion upon it, as to affect our Underſtanding with ſome particular Knowledge of the Body it ſelf, whereby we are enabled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from other Bodies. And as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40650:222"/> he can directly apply all this to the Senſes of Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, and Touching, of which he may be as good, or a better Maſter than other Men: So, by way of Analogy from theſe Senſes, he will be able to make ſome imperfect ſort of Repreſentation to himſelf, what ſort of thing Sight is; and what Light, and Colours are; though directly, and particularly, he knows no more of them, than if he had never heard of them. Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Bodies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. tells us of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noble Man, who was born ſo abſolutely deaf, that if a Gun were ſhot off cloſe by his Ear, he could not hear it; and yet was taught to ſpeak very diſtinctly; and, by the motion of any Mans Mouth, ſo perfectly to underſtand what he ſaid, as that he would not loſe a word in a whole days Converſation. Now the Doctrine of Sounds and Muſick muſt of Neceſſity have been as much above this Mans Reaſon, as that of Light and Colours, was above the blind Mans, of whom I but now ſpoke; and yet there might very good Aſſurance have been given to the one, that there was ſuch a Senſe as Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40650:222"/> and ſuch a thing as a Sound, as well as there was unto the other, in the caſe of Light and Colours.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And now to apply what has been ſaid, to the Controverſie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity, and Incarnation of our Saviour. And here the Iſſue which I am now trying, preſuppoſes theſe three things: Firſt, That the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove the Truth of theſe Doctrines, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the purpoſe for which they are alledged, if we interpret them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural Order, and uſual ſignification of the Words and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them. Secondly, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines themſelves are not contrary to Reaſon, as not implying any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; ſee <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. But Thirdly, That they are altogether above our Reaſon, becauſe we cannot frame any Notion or Idea of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Union, and Diſtinction, which is between the Three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, or between the two Natures which are in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Which three things being taken for granted, the queſtion that is to be determined, is, Whether or no it be a ſufficient ground for a Man to deny his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40650:223"/> Aſſent to the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarnation of Chriſt, becauſe they are above his Reaſon?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And here, in the firſt place, it is very plain, That although we cannot by any means comprehend the things themſelves, yet we do ſo far under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the Terms in which theſe Doctrines are expreſſed, as clearly to perceive that they are not a company of inſignificant Words put together, to make a ſound, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing. What a <hi>Perſon</hi> is, we know; though we cannot tell what ſort of Perſons the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are; and how their Perſonal Diſtinction between themſelves, particularly and fully dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that of Men, one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What it is to be <hi>One,</hi> we well underſtand, although we cannot frame an Idea of that ſpecial Union which is between thoſe Divine Perſons. What it is for one being to <hi>generate</hi> another, and what to <hi>proceed</hi> from another, we are not ignorant; although the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner of the Generation of the Son of God, and the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, be beyond our Capacity to conceive. And Laſtly, What it is for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40650:223"/> two Beings to be <hi>Vnited</hi> together, we can very well apprehend; although we pretend not to know the manner of That Union which is between the two Natures in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. From whence it plainly follows, That theſe Doctrines, though <hi>above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> do yet ſo far ſtand upon equal Terms with thoſe Doctrines which I have termed <hi>reconcilable to Reaſon, Sect.</hi> 8. That as our Reaſon may be plainly and poſitive convinced from its own Principles alone, of the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of the one; ſo is there no Principle of our Reaſon which can reach ſo far as to prove or demonſtrate any <hi>impoſſibility</hi> in the other. And where there is no Contradiction, or Impoſſibility, in a Doctrine, it will undeniably follow, that that ſame Doctrine may poſſibly be true. And where ever a Man is convinced of the poſſibility of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if the Truth of that ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine appears to him to be reſtified by any Perſon, of whoſe Veracity he cannot entertain any manner of doubt, he cannot refuſe to give his Aſſent to it; as I have ſaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Since then the Veracity of God admits of no manner of doubt, and the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40650:224"/> are by both Parties in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute allowed of, as moſt Authentick Records of the Doctrines of Faith, and Rules of Life, which God has made known, and revealed to the World. And laſtly, ſince we here ſuppoſe, that the Doctrine of the Trinity, and that of the Incarnation of Chriſt, do neither of them contain, or imply, any Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Contradiction, although they are both of them above our Reaſon, it will follow, that if all, or any of the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove theſe Doctrines, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the common way of interpreting all Books, (of which ſee <hi>Part 1. Sect.</hi> 25.) do fairly (and without being wreſted) contain (either in themſelves, or their evident Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences) thoſe ſame Doctrines which they are alledged to eſtabliſh, there can be no juſt Cauſe why any Man ſhould deny his Aſſent to them. But if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, it be ſtill urged, that it is not poſſible for a Man expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to believe a thing of which he can frame no Conception or Idea; I muſt refer him to the Story of the blind Man, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. which ſeems to me abundantly to evince the contrary.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40650:224"/> And why we ſhould not believe the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, upon the Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures, as well as the blind Man did the Exiſtence of Light and Colours, upon the Teſtimony of other Men; joyned with that collateral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment which I have mentioned, I profeſs I can ſee no manner of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And as in my Book, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 71. I have advertiſed my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I have purpoſely avoided the uſe of certain Words and Terms, for the Reaſon there given: So muſt I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to take notice, that for the like Reaſon, I have both in my Book, and in this Appendix, omitted ſo much as to mention the word <hi>Myſtery,</hi> about which, ſo great a Noiſe has of late been made. Whether this ſame Term <hi>Myſtery,</hi> be always uſed in the New Teſtament, in the very ſame (and no other) Signification as it is underſtood by Heathen Authors? Or, Whether other ſorts of things, by a very allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Analogy, are not alſo there called Myſteries, upon account of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; becauſe <hi>we know them but in part, and ſee</hi> them but <hi>as in a Glaſs darkly.</hi> Or, Laſtly, Whether there be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40650:225"/> any thing in Chriſtianity, which may <hi>properly</hi> be called a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> according to the genuine meaning of that Term; to me ſeems to be no more but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <hi>about a word,</hi> which the Apoſtle expreſly forbids. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. But whatever may be determined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propriety of the Word, the thing if ſelf ſeems to me, to be very evident, that there are ſome Doctrines in Chriſtianity, which are above our Reaſon, and yet that this is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for the denial of our Aſſent to them.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And if I am told, that after all this, there is no greater obſcurity in any of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, than what there is in all natural Beings, with which we moſt familiarly converſe; whoſe <hi>real Eſſence</hi> we cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, but muſt content our ſelves with a ſort of Superficial Knowledge of them, which is cauſed by thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which they make upon our outward Organs; which, at moſt, can be termed but a <hi>nominal Eſſence;</hi> ſo that even <hi>a ſpire of Graſs, a Stick, a Stone,</hi> or any other natural Being, may upon this account, as truly be termed <hi>Myſtericus,</hi> as the moſt ſublime Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40650:225"/> of Religion. I ſhall only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it mightily raiſes my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to hear Men ſo freely acknowledge, that in every other thing whatſoever, there is ſomething which is above their Reaſon, and to which their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot reach; and yet, that they will not allow the ſame in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But I know it will be objected, that the firſt of thoſe three Suppoſitions which I have laid down, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. will by no means be granted by the <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> for they are ſo far from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Texts of Scripture, which are brought to prove the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarnation, to be any way ſufficient to that purpoſe; that on the contrary, they do, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aſſurance, undertake to bring other and contrary Interpetations of thoſe very Paſſages, which they pretend to be far more Rational and Natural. To which I ſhall only Anſwer, that this is all that I aim at in this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, that the Iſſue of theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies may be placed upon that which is the only true Foundation for it; I mean, the Authority of the Holy Scriptures; and that blind Men would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40650:226"/> not take upon them, by the ſtrength of their Reaſon, to diſcuſs Problems, and frame Concluſions concerning Light and Colours, of which they can have no true or ſufficient Idea. I am very ſenſible that learned Men, who have their Minds ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with any Opinion, may, by their Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms, and Paraphraſes, and ſuch like Engines, torture and ſcrew almoſt any Text of Scripture, till they make it look with another Aſpect from what is truly its own, and ſeem to confeſs what really it never thought or meant. But if we would always take thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations which flow of themſelves, and not thoſe which are violently preſſed from the Scripture, (which I think is the faireſt way of expounding all Speeches and Diſcourſes whatſoever) I cannot, for my part, ſee how we can otherwiſe conclude, concerning the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than as I have done, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. 37.</p>
